    "## Introduction to Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "On Tuesday, the class utilized Python's NLTK in order to perform text analysis. Tuesday's module focused greatly on tokenizing parts of strings and then using the library's in-built functions to analyze those tokens. Today, we will be learning about another technique of text analysis that involves using a special type of code called \"regular expressions\". For this module, we will be using functions from the 're' library of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals:\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to gain an introductory understanding of how regular expressions can be used with large portions of text to cleanly pull data from the text. Regular expressions can seem overwhelming at first, but with practice, they become easier to use. The goal is to add the usage of regular expressions to your text analysis 'toolbox'; from there, how you choose to analyze your own data is based on your own design and vision! Don't worry if you don't understand everything! Ask questions if you require assistance.\n",

    "## Structure of Strings in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from Tuesday, a string (in coding jargon) is a type of variable that consists of a sequence of characters in a particular order. Characters can be both letters and numbers, and the sequence in a string is ordered. Even though strings are fixed variables, it is still possible to manipuate them and gain more information from within them. In Python, strings exist in a fashion analogous to lists. Similar to how we can pick elements in order from an ordered list, we can do the same for characters within a Python string. One important fact to keep in mind is that Python indexing starts at 0; that is to say that the first element in any Python list structure is actually indexed at 0.\n",

    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "On Tuesday, you worked with Python's NLTK to tokenize words and sort/structure/manipulate them using the built functions. Regular expressions are an alternative way to 'search' for information within strings. At their most basic level, regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a pattern with which the computer searches. Regular expressions give us immense power by allowing us to search within extremly large portions of text for very specific types of text/information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are given a farm of various animals. Think of regular expressions as defining features that help us find exactly what we are looking for. In my farm, I want to search for animals that are brown, have 4 legs, and weigh more than 10 pounds. Each of those animal characteristics is analogous to a \"sequences of characters\" in the context of regular expressions. I may be looking for words that contain capital letters, or words that specifically start with a certain sequence of characters, similarly to how I am looking for brown animals, or animals with 4 legs.\n",

Inter-American CoffeeAgreement..................... 138\\n\\n'OT'\\n\\nFOREWORD\\n\\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of\\n\\ncoffee in the economic life of the American republics. All\\n\\nthe American republics consume coffee in appreciable quan\\n\\ntities, and in fourteen of these republics it is regularly pro\\n\\nduced for export. Of all the commodities imported by the\\n\\nUnited States from the other American republics, coffee is\\n\\nby far the greatest in value. The proceeds derived from its\\n\\nsale abroad are widely distributed among the inhabitants of\\n\\nthe exporting country. So closely is coffee allied to the day- to-day living conditions of so many people that it constitutes\\n\\nan admirable economic barometer for those countries where\\n\\nits production is important. We are all familiar with the\\n\\nhuge export crops of Brazil and Colombia; but perhaps less\\n\\nwell known is the fact that in normal times coffee represents\\n\\napproximately 90% by value of all exports from the Republic\\n\\nof El Salvador. In other words, not only is the volume of\\n\\ntrade tremendous in the larger producing countries, but the\\n\\nproportion of coffee in the export trade of many of the\\n\\nsmaller producing countries is very high. It is apparent,\\n\\ntherefore, that the prosperity and well-being of the Ameri\\n\\ncan coffee-producing republics depend in large measure on\\n\\nthe maintenance of stable and orderly market conditions\\n\\nfor this crop.\\n\\nThe economic benefits to be derived from\\n\\na prosper\\n\\nous export trade in coffee are to be measured not only in\\n\\nterms of the direct proceeds received by exporters and\\n\\ngrowers, but also in\\n\\na variety of indirect ways. The foreign\\n\\nexchange difficulties experienced in recent years by most\\n\\nof the American republics were greatly aggravated by the\\n\\ndepressed export prices for coffee during that period. To\\n\\nthe extent that improved marketing conditions bring about\\n\\nincreased foreign exchange availabilities in such countries,\\n\\nto that extent local currencies are strengthened and problems\\n\\nof arbitrary and enforced exchange controls alleviated.\\n\\nFurthermore, increased purchasing power in the producing\\n\\ncountries, combined with increased availabilities of dollar\\n\\nexchange, makes it possible for those countries to increase\\n\\nproportionately their purchases of manufactured goods and\\n\\nfoodstuffs, and to service more adequately their dollar finan- cial obligations, whether commercial or governmental. Cof- fee exemplifies perhaps more than any other commodity the\\n\\nessential nature of international trade, i.e., an exchange of\\n\\ngoods rather than a mere process of selling. If a normal and\\n\\nstable market for coffee ceases to exist, normal two-way\\n\\ntrade becomes unbalanced and serious consequences result.\\n\\nThis was precisely the situation during the decade pre- ceding the outbreak of the European war. In 1931 Brazil\\n\\ncommenced its current program of coffee destruction, in\\n\\norder to avoid the accumulation of surpluses, and in that\\n\\nway attempted to prevent the price of exported coffee from\\n\\nfalling to ruinous levels. Other producing countries natural- ly benefited by the Brazilian program. It is apparent that\\n\\nunder such conditions the coffee trade was operating on an\\n\\nabnormal basis, and that sooner or later corrective action\\n\\nwould have to be taken.\\n\\nIt was yrith this end in view that certain coffee-produc- ing countries, cognizant of their common problem, sent dele- gates to the First Pan American Coffee Conference, held at\\n\\nBogota, Colombia, in October 1936. At that Conference\\n\\nvarious proposed measures intended to be of benefit to the\\n\\ncoffee trade were discussed, including the highly controver- sial questions of export quotas and price controls. No defini\\xad\\n\\n\", '\\n\\ntive agreements were reached, and accordingly there was\\n\\nconvened at Habana, Cuba, in August 1937 the Second Pan\\n\\nAmerican Coffee Conference. The basic problem still re- mained unsolved, however, and market conditions deter- iorated still further.\\n\\nThis unstable condition in the coffee market, character- ized by excess supplies, destruction of coffee surpluses in\\n\\nBrazil, and depressed prices, continued up to the outbreak of\\n\\nthe European war in September 1939. From that point on\\n\\nthe situation deteriorated even further. The abrupt cur- tailment of the important European market due to war\\n\\nconditions greatly aggravated the surplus problem and forced\\n\\nprices down still further to ruinous levels. With the normal\\n\\nmarket for around 10,000,000 bags of coffee almost com- pletely cut off, there developed uncontrolled competitive\\n\\nefforts to dump in the United States market—the only large\\n\\nand completely accessible market still open—excessive quan- tities of coffee at disastrous prices. The outlook for coffee\\n\\nproducers in the early months of 1940 could hardly have\\n\\nbeen less promising.\\n\\nConfronted by conditions far worse than those which\\n\\nthey had previously experienced, the coffee-producing Amer- ican republics once more convened for the Third Pan\\n\\nAmerican Coffee Conference, held in New York during the\\n\\nmonths of June and July, 1940. The United States Govern- ment manifested a sympathetic interest in the objectives of\\n\\nthis Conference, and at the invitation of the Conference the\\n\\nDepartment of State sent a representative to be present at\\n\\nthe meetings in the capacity of observer. A tentative plan\\n\\nfor export quotas was drawn up by the Conference, but\\n\\nsince it failed to obtain the approval of all of the Govern\\xad\\n\\n', '\\n\\nments the problem still remained unsolved. Meanwhile, new\\n\\ncrops were coming on the market shortly, at the same time\\n\\nthat war conditions were becoming intensified.\\n\\nIt was at this juncture that the Inter-American Finan- cial and Economic Advisory Committee, which had been\\n\\ncreated by the First Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\\n\\nAmerican Republic held at Panama in 1939, and which had\\n\\nbeen given broad powers by the Second Meeting of Ministers\\n\\nof Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, at Habana in\\n\\n1940, undertook to study the problem with a view to work- ing out a cooperative solution. This Committee appointed\\n\\na Subcommittee on Coffee, which immediately undertook the\\n\\narduous task of drawing up a plan for meeting the coffee\\n\\ncrisis. These negotiations of the Subcommittee on Coffee\\n\\nlasted from August until November 28, 1940, the date on\\n\\nwhich fourteen American coffee-producing republics and the\\n\\nUnited States signed the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\nDuring the following months the participating coun- tries, following their respective constitutional procedures,\\n\\ntook the necessary steps to bring the Agreement into effective\\n\\noperation. Following ratification by a number of the coun- tries the Agreement was brought into effect by means of a\\n\\nprotocol signed on April 15, 1941, at the Pan American\\n\\nUnion. From that date the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment has been legally effective, and it is the purpose of the\\n\\npresent Report to describe its operation and administration\\n\\nby the Inter-American Coffee Board.\\n\\nThe present Report covers the activities of the Inter- American Coffee Board in its administration of the Agree- ment from April 17, 1941, the date of the first meeting of the\\n\\nBoard, until September 30, 1942, the end of the second\\n\\n', '\\n\\nquota year. The major activities of the Board are described\\n\\nunder separate headings, providing in this way a convenient\\n\\nsummary of the Board’s handling of certain important\\n\\nproblems. This section of the Report is followed by a\\n\\nchronological summary of the minutes of each meeting of the\\n\\nBoard since its inception, giving the date and number of\\n\\neach meeting and a list of the subjects discussed. Appended\\n\\nto the Report are the full ofl&cial texts of all resolutions ap- proved by the Board, and other important official docu- ments throwing light on its activities. In the final section\\n\\nof the Report there is reproduced the complete text of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement, in order that all of its\\n\\nprovisions may be readily available for convenient reference.\\n\\nThe Board believes that the material presented herewith is\\n\\nadequate to enable the reader to inform himself fully re- garding the Board’s activities, and to reach his own conclusion\\n\\nregarding the results achieved.\\n\\nThis Report is necessarily concerned with the factual\\n\\ndetails and technical aspects of the operation and adminis- tration of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Never- theless, the Report would not be complete if mention were\\n\\nnot made at this point of the high spirit of cooperation which\\n\\nhas been achieved by the Board in facing important problems,\\n\\nand the development of a common aspiration to work for\\n\\nthe common welfare in all matters related to coffee. Indi- vidual interests are brought before the Board and discussed,\\n\\nas a natural and logical function of the Board; but the Dele- gates all are motivated by a sincere desire to reconcile in so\\n\\nfar as may be possible the individual interests involved with\\n\\nthose of the entire coffee community. It is the hope of the\\n\\nDelegates, in submitting this Report of their activities, that\\n\\n', '\\n\\nthis same high ideal will be reflected in all countries and have\\n\\na beneficent effect on the entire coffee industry.\\n\\nEurico Venteado\\n\\nBrazil\\n\\nEnrique Lopez Herrarte\\n\\nGuatemala\\n\\nMario Camargo\\n\\nColombia\\n\\nAndre Liautaud\\n\\nHaiti\\n\\nLuis Fernandez\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nJulian R.

MAJOR ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD\\n\\nThe major activities of the Inter-American Coffee Board,\\n\\nfrom its first meeting on April 17, 1941, to September 30,\\n\\n1942, are summarized and briefly discussed below under the\\n\\nfollowing headings:\\n\\n1. Election of Officers\\n\\n2. Organization of the Secretariat\\n\\n3. Adjustment of Quotas under Article III\\n\\n4. Adjustment of Quotas under Article VIII\\n\\n5. Advance Shipments\\n\\n6. Statistics\\n\\n7. Relations with the United States Coffee Trade\\n\\n8. Diverted Shipments\\n\\n9. Minimum Prices\\n\\n10. Maximum Prices\\n\\n11. Export Certificates\\n\\n12.

Renewal of Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\n1. Election of officers.\\n\\nThe first meeting of the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nwas held on April 17, 1941, at the Pan American Union.\\n\\nPresiding at the opening of the meeting was the Honorable\\n\\nDr. Hector David Castro, Minister of El Salvador to Wash- ington, and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Coffee of the\\n\\nInter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Com- mittee. The Subcommittee on Coffee had completed its\\n\\nlabors with the final entry into effect of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement, and on April 17, 1941, turned over its\\n\\nfunctions in relation to coffee to the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard.\\n\\nThe first action taken by the Board was the election of\\n\\nofficers. The results of the elections were as follows:\\n\\nChairman, Mr. Paul C. Daniels, United States\\n\\nVice Chairman, Senhor Eurico Penteado, Brazil\\n\\nMembers of Executive Committee:\\n\\nSenor Roberto Aguilar Trigueros, Chairman\\n\\nSenhor Eurico Penteado\\n\\nSenor Manuel Mejia\\n\\nSenor Enrique Lopez Herrarte\\n\\nMr. Paul C. Daniels\\n\\nAt the same meeting it was agreed that the tenure of\\n\\noffice of the aforesaid officers of the Board would be for a\\n\\nperiod of one year. Accordingly, at the meeting held on\\n\\nApril 7, 1942 elections were again held, and the same officers\\n\\nwere reelected for another period of one year.\\n\\nThe Chairman of the Executive Committee rendered\\n\\nvaluable service to the Board during the period under review\\n\\n', '\\n\\nthrough his careful supervision of the organization and\\n\\nadministration of the Board’s financial and budgetary prob- lems and other administrative matters. Important adminis- trative matters were generally referred to the Executive Com- mittee for recommendation, prior to approval by the entire\\n\\nBoard.\\n\\n2.Organization of the Secretariat. ^\\n\\nArticle XII of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\nrequires the Board to \"appoint a Secretary and take all other\\n\\nnecessary measures to establish a Secretariat which shall be\\n\\nentirely free and independent of any other national or inter- national organization or institution”. Among the first ac- tions by the Board was the fulfillment of its obligations under\\n\\nthe aforesaid Article XII. After careful consideration the\\n\\nposition of Secretary was offered to Mr. Herbert Delafield,\\n\\nan experienced and distinguished representative of the United\\n\\nStates coffee trade, past-President of the Associated Coffee\\n\\nIndustries of America (now National Coffee Association)\\n\\nand co-founder of the joint coffee promotion campaign\\n\\nundertaken by the Pan American Coffee Bureau in coopera- tion with the National Coffee Association. Much to the\\n\\ngratification of the Board Mr. Delafield accepted this poa- tion, and his acceptance was enthusiastically welcomed not\\n\\nonly by the Delegates but by the entire United States coffee\\n\\nindustry.\\n\\nAs Assistant Secretary the Board was fortunate in ob- taining the services of Mr. Enrique Lewis Comas, who had\\n\\nbeen serving as Secretary of the Inter-American Financial and\\n\\nEconomic Advisory Committee, where a large part of his\\n\\nwork related to the negotiation of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement by the Subcommittee on Coffee. In June 1942\\n\\n', '\\n\\nMr. Lewis Comas was given indefinite leave of absence from\\n\\nhis duties with the Board in order to enter the armed forces.\\n\\nThe expenses of the Secretariat are met by annual con- tributions from the participating Governments, in accord- ance with the proportions established by Article XIII of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement. The Board approved its\\n\\nbudget for the first quota year in the amount of $18,000, and\\n\\nso informed the participating Governments in a letter ap- proved by the Board on May 8, 1942 (Appendix No. 4).\\n\\nBy a resolution of July 1, 1941 the Board approved its\\n\\nbudget for the second quota year ending September 30,\\n\\n1942, in the amount of $24,000 (Appendix No. 10). Similar\\n\\naction was taken by the Board at its meeting of August 5,\\n\\n1942 when it approved its budget for the third quota year\\n\\nin the same amount (Appendix No. 34). At the end of the\\n\\nperiod under review the Board’s finances were in satisfactory\\n\\ncondition, with a cash balance in the Riggs National Bank of\\n\\nWashington of $26,106.5 5. It should be noted, however, that\\n\\nduring this period the Board published no report of its activi- ties, and that the anticipated expenses for the publication of\\n\\nsuch a report will constitute an important item of expendi- ture.\\n\\nThe first few meetings of the Board were held in the Pan\\n\\nAmerican Union, but in July 1941 the Board became in- stalled in its own offices at 2400 16th Street, Washington,\\n\\nD. C. The Secretariat functions in these offces, and meet- ings of the Board are likewise held there. The quarters are\\n\\nvery satisfactory for the Board’s purposes, providing excel- lent offce space, a large size Board room, and a convenient\\n\\nlocation in a large building of good appearance.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nIt is the desire of the Delegates to the Board that its\\n\\noffces be considered by all members of the coffee trade, all\\n\\noffcials from any country interested in coffee, and the public\\n\\nat large as a central meeting point for the exchange of in- formation relating to coffee. Close contact is maintained by\\n\\nMr. Delafield with all Government agencies in Washington,\\n\\nand in fact one of the most useful services which the Board\\n\\nhas been glad to perform through the Secretariat is the main- tenance and establishment of intimate contact between all\\n\\npersons and entities interested in coffee. This new facility,\\n\\nwhich has never before existed, has been particularly useful\\n\\nduring the trying period brought about by the war, and is\\n\\nreferred to in Section 17, \"Wartime Regulations in the United\\n\\nStates”. It is the sincere hope of the entire Board that its use- fulness in this broad field of action, which far transcends its\\n\\nimmediate duties in connection with the adjustment of the\\n\\nquotas, may contribute with increasing effectiveness to the\\n\\nelimination of misunderstandings and diffculties and to its\\n\\nbasic objective, the orderly marketing of coffee.\\n\\n3. Adjustment of qtwtas under Article III,\\n\\nArticle III of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\nprovides that the Inter-American Coffee Board \"shall have\\n\\nthe authority to increase or decrease the quotas for the United\\n\\nStates market in order to adjust supplies to estimated require- ments”. In order to avoid in so far as possible speculative\\n\\nactivity in the coffee market whenever the Board should hold\\n\\na meeting, it was provided that these normal or routine quota\\n\\nadjustments should take place no oftener than once every six\\n\\nmonths, and that any change at any one time should not ex- ceed 5% of the basis quotas specified in Article I. The\\n\\nadjustment of quotas under Article III is one of the basic im- portant functions of the Inter-American Coffee Board.\\n\\nDuring the period covered by this Report, that is to say,\\n\\nApril 17, 1941, to September 30, 1942, the Board has twice\\n\\nauthorized changes in the quotas in accordance with the fore- going procedure. At the very first meeting of the Board,\\n\\nheld on April 17, 1941, the subject was brought up for the\\n\\nfirst time, and there was discussion as to whether the quotas\\n\\nfor the United States market should be increased. In the\\n\\ncourse of the next few meetings this question was further\\n\\ndiscussed, and on May 28, 1941 the Board approved a resolu- tion increasing the quotas for the United States market by 5%\\n\\n(Appendix No. 7). The reasons for this increase were prim- arily the increased consumption of coffee on the part of the\\n\\ncivilian population of the United States, combined with the\\n\\ngreatly increased consumption by the armed forces.\\n\\nThe increase approved on May 28, 1941, effective June\\n\\n1, 1941, was 5% of the basic quotas, with the result that\\n\\nthe quotas from June 1 on stood at 105% of the basic quotas.\\n\\nHowever, due to the application of the “weighted average”\\n\\nformula provided in Article III, the net effect of this change\\n\\non the quotas for the quota year was only 1.671%, or 259,-\\n\\n757 bags for the signatory countries.\\n\\nThe next adjustments of the quotas for the United States\\n\\nmarket were effected under the provisions of Article VIII of\\n\\nthe Agreement, and are discussed separately in the subsequent\\n\\nsection of this Report. The only other modification of the\\n\\nquotas under Article III during the period under review was\\n\\non February 25, 1942, when the Board approved a resolu- tion increasing the quotas for the United States market by\\n\\nan additional 5% of the basis quotas, effective February 26,\\n\\n1942 (Appendix No. 25). This resolution had the effect\\n\\nof increasing the rate of entry of coffee into the United States\\n\\nfrom 110% of the basic quotas to 115%, and the latter\\n\\n[14\\'J\\n\\nfigure remained in effect until a subsequent emergency in- crease of the quotas under Article VIII, approved on July 15,\\n\\n1942.\\n\\n4. Adjustment of quotas under Article VIIL\\n\\nIn addition to the normal manner for adjusting the\\n\\nquotas provided for in Article III of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement, provision is likewise made in Article VIII\\n\\nof the Agreement for emergency increases in the quotas for\\n\\nthe United States market in the event that there should be\\n\\nforeseen an imminent shortage of coffee in the United States\\n\\nmarket in relation to its requirements. At the time of nego- tiating the Inter-American Coffee Agreement the inclusion\\n\\nof this Article was deemed to be a necessary safeguard for\\n\\nprotecting the interests of coffee consumers in the United\\n\\nStates against a shortage of coffee brought about artificially\\n\\nas a result of the operation of the Agreement. Indeed, had\\n\\nit not been for the inclusion of the safeguards provided in\\n\\nthis Article it is probable that the United States would have\\n\\nbeen unwilling to cooperate in the estabHshment of a quota\\n\\nplan, and that the entire cooperative program for the orderly\\n\\nmarketing of coffee established by the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement would never have been achieved.\\n\\nAn additional advantage of that Article has been that it\\n\\nhas provided an admirable means for giving effect to the\\n\\npolicy of the Inter-American Coffee Board to administer\\n\\nthe Agreement in such a way as to achieve the maximum\\n\\nflexibility under difficult war conditions. Through its timely\\n\\napplication it has been possible to maintain the uninterrupted\\n\\nflow of coffee to the United States market from countries\\n\\nable to supply and ship such coffee at a time when shipping\\n\\nconditions generally have seriously impeded the movement\\n\\n', '\\n\\nof coffee to the United States. This flexibility has been\\n\\nachieved without sacrificing in any sense the basic program\\n\\nfor the orderly marketing of coffee established in the other\\n\\narticles of the Agreement, and has made it possible for the\\n\\nentire program to continue uninterrupted during the war\\n\\nperiod rather than being confronted with the necessity of a\\n\\npartial or complete suspension of the provisions of the\\n\\nAgreement.\\n\\nDuring the first half of 1941, at a time when civilian\\n\\nand military consumption of coffee in the United States was\\n\\nincreasing, rising prices in the United States market stimulated\\n\\nbuying and in some cases the speculative withholding of\\n\\ncoffee from the market, with the result that roasting estab- lishments were finding it difficult to meet their require- ments on fair terms. These conditions assumed serious pro- portions during July. With a view to alleviating the\\n\\nsituation and avoiding serious damage to the industry the\\n\\nBoard approved a resolution on August 2, 1941 increasing\\n\\nthe quotas for the United States market by an additional\\n\\n20%, effective August 11, 1941 (Appendix No. 17). Be- cause of the earlier increase in the quotas under Article III,\\n\\neffective June 1,1941, the additional 20% increase established\\n\\nthe quotas for the United States market at 125% of the\\n\\nbasis quotas for the ensuing period.\\n\\nOn October 23, 1941, following the conclusion of cer- tain other agreements intended to facilitate the smooth flow\\n\\nof coffee to the United States market, it was decided that\\n\\nthe emergency increase had remained in effect long enough\\n\\nto produce the desired results in correcting the abnormal\\n\\nmarket situation existing a few months earlier, and accord- ingly, by unanimous vote, the Board approved a resolution ad-\\n\\n', '\\n\\njusting the quotas at 110% of the basic quotas (Appendix\\n\\nNo. 20).\\n\\nDuring the first half of 1942 maritime facilities for the\\n\\nshipment of coffee to the United States became steadily\\n\\nworse as a result of losses at sea and the heavy burdens placed\\n\\non available shipping because of the essential requirements\\n\\nof war. It became apparent that the effective control of the\\n\\nvolume of coffee moving to the United States market was\\n\\nimposed solely by shipping availabilities, rather than by the\\n\\nquota limitations established by the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement. At the same time, however, certain countries\\n\\nhappening to enjoy relatively favorable maritime facilities\\n\\nwere able to export to the United States the full amount of\\n\\nthe quotas as then existing. The Delegates to the Inter- American Coffee Board were unanimously of the opinion that\\n\\nit was to the general advantage of all coffee-producing\\n\\ncountries, as well as to the United States, for every unneces- sary obstacle to be removed which might impede the freest\\n\\npossible flow of coffee to the United States from available\\n\\nsources. Were the Board to fail to take appropriate action\\n\\nalong this line and expose itself to the charge of having con- tributed to the imminent shortage of coffee in the United\\n\\nStates market, the great consuming public would have had a\\n\\nmotive for just and legitimate complaint. As indicated above,\\n\\nhowever, the Board spontaneously adopted a policy of flexibi- lity, which found concrete manifestation in its resolution of\\n\\nJuly 15, 1942 increasing the quotas to 277% of the basic\\n\\nquota (Appendix No. 33). This action of the Board was\\n\\nexplained and commented upon in a statement released\\n\\nsimultaneously by the Board, which described actions already\\n\\ntaken to facilitate the movement of coffee to the United\\n\\nStates market and the reasons underlying the resolution of\\n\\n', '\\n\\nJuly 15 (Appendix No. 32). In the same resolution of July\\n\\n15 it was provided that at the beginning of the next quota\\n\\nyear on October 1, 1942, the quotas would be set at 110%\\n\\nof the basic quotas. It was xmderstood that subsequent\\n\\nchanges, if any, in the quotas would be made in the light of\\n\\ncircumstances existing during the coming year.\\n\\n5. Advance shipments.\\n\\nUnder a rigid application of the quota system it would\\n\\nbe possible for a given producing country to fill its quota for\\n\\nthe United States market long before the end of the quota\\n\\nyear, and then be prevented from making further ship- ments because of the applicable provisions of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement. Any such interruption in the\\n\\nflow of coffee to the consuming market would bring about an\\n\\nirregularity in the movement of coffee to the United States,\\n\\nadd to the difficulties of efficient loading and routing of ships,\\n\\nand in general be contrary to the basic principle of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement which, as stated in the preamble\\n\\nthereof, is to promote the orderly marketing of coffee.\\n\\nIn recognition of the aforementioned circumstances\\n\\nthe Inter-American Coffee Board has taken action to pro- vide for flexibility in the operation of the quota system so as\\n\\nto avoid a cessation of shipments towards the end of the\\n\\nquota year. On May 28, 1941 a resolution was approved by\\n\\nthe Board authorizing advance shipments of coffee from the\\n\\nproducing countries during the current quota year, these\\n\\nshipments to be charged to the quota for the following year\\n\\n(Appendix No. 8). The advance shipments authorized by\\n\\nthis resolution were limited to 15 % of the basic quotas.\\n\\nSimilar action was taken by the Board at its meeting\\n\\nof October 23, 1941, when it again approved a resolution\\n\\n', '\\n\\nauthorizing advance shipments chargeable to next year’s\\n\\nquotas up to the limit of 15% of the basic quotas (Appendix\\n\\nNo. 21).\\n\\nWith the increasing difficulty being encountered in the\\n\\nshipment of coffee to the United States due to the scarcity of\\n\\nships, combined with the fact that some producing countries\\n\\nwere already about to fill their quota for the United States\\n\\nmarket, the Board issued a public statement on March 5,\\n\\n1942 annoimcing its intention to eliminate the existing 15%\\n\\nlimitation on advance shipments if that limit should come to\\n\\nbe an obstacle (Appendix No. 26). In accordance with this\\n\\nadvance statement the Board approved a resolution on April\\n\\n29, 1942 eliminating the aforesaid limit of 15%, in accord- ance with its policy of administering the quotas in such a way\\n\\nas to make it possible to utilize all available shipping space\\n\\nfor the transportation of coffee to the United States (Ap- pendix No. 30). This resolution remained in effect during\\n\\nthe remainder of the period covered by this Report.\\n\\n6. Statistics.\\n\\nAmong the specified powers and duties of the Inter- American Coffee Board, under the provisions of the Agree- ment, are those set forth in Article X(e), which reads as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n**To seek such information as it may deem neces- sary to the proper operation and administration of this\\n\\nAgreement; and to publish such information as it may\\n\\nconsider desirable;”\\n\\nIt is apparent that the orderly marketing of coffee will\\n\\nbe greatly facilitated by the prompt and Complete compila- tion of pertinent statistical data relating to coffee and the\\n\\n', '\\n\\ndistribution of this information not only to governmental\\n\\nrepresentatives charged with the administration of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, but also to all individuals or\\n\\nconcerns engaged in the coffee business. Recognizing this\\n\\nneed, the Board took steps to meet it from the very outset.\\n\\nAt its first meeting the Board debated the advisability of\\n\\nobtaining prompt and frequent figures on sales registrations in\\n\\nproducing countries, and at its second meeting, held on April\\n\\n23, 1941, approved a resolution requesting the participating\\n\\nGovernments to submit such statistics promptly each week\\n\\n(Appendix No. 3). At a subsequent meeting of the Board,\\n\\nheld on July 17, 1941, the need was brought out of estab- lishing a uniform procedure for the submission of such\\n\\nstatistics so as to facilitate their use by the Board, and there\\n\\nwas accordingly approved a standard form to be used by all\\n\\ncountries in submitting statistics on sales registrations and\\n\\nexports (Appendix No. 9). Gradually the different parti- cipating countries began supplying the Board with statistical\\n\\ndata at regular intervals, and with a view to bringing this\\n\\ninformation together in useful form the Board commenced\\n\\nthe publication of a Weekly Statistical Bulletin. The first\\n\\nissue of this Statistical Bulletin appeared on February 10,\\n\\n1942, and contained statistics under the following headings:\\n\\nBasic quotas for the United States market\\n\\nRevised quotas for the United States market\\n\\nSales registrations in producing countries for the\\n\\nUnited States market\\n\\nExports from producing countries to the United\\n\\nStates market\\n\\nImports into the United States from producing\\n\\ncountries participating in the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement, and likewise from non- signatory countries\\n\\n', '\\n\\nBasic quotas for the market outside the United\\n\\nStates\\n\\nRevised quotas for the market outside the United\\n\\nStates\\n\\nSales registrations for the market outside the United\\n\\nStates\\n\\nExports to the market outside the United States\\n\\nLater on additional statistical data of value was included\\n\\nin the Bulletin, and as of September 30, 1942 there were\\n\\nincluded in the Bulletin, in addition to the items listed above,\\n\\nthe following items:\\n\\nStocks of green coffee in the United States\\n\\nVolume of coffee roasted in the United States\\n\\nCoffee in General Order Warehouse and Foreign\\n\\nTrade Zone\\n\\nAt the end of the period under review plans were being\\n\\nmade to include likewise the following additional items:\\n\\nStocks of green coffee in producing countries\\n\\n(a) at ports (b) in interior (c) total\\n\\nEstimated crop production, per quota year, for\\n\\neach producing country\\n\\nThe statistical service now being offered by the Inter- American Coffee Board is an entirely new service in the\\n\\nhistory of the coffee industry. For the first time an ofiEcial\\n\\norganization is compiling and publishing regularly in one\\n\\nbulletin official statistics received directly from 15 countries,\\n\\ncovering the major phases of the production, importation and\\n\\nconsumption of coffee. It is the belief of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board that this new statistical service will constitute a\\n\\nnotable contribution to the orderly marketing of coffee.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n7. Relations with the United States coffee trade.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard recognized the desirabiUty of maintaining close con- tact with the coffee trade and industry of the United States,\\n\\nin order to achieve harmonious relationships and avoid, so far\\n\\nas possible, any basis for controversy. Trade interests are\\n\\nnaturally vitally affected by any broad program of govern- mental control, and the Board has consistently taken the view\\n\\nthat such legitimate interests should be accorded every op- portunity to make their views known, and that everything\\n\\npossible should be done to administer the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement in such a way as to eliminate, so far as pos- sible, any unnecessary inconvenience or damage to legitimate\\n\\ntrade interests. Provision for meetings for the aforesaid pur- poses with trade interests is contained in Article XVIII of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\nThe aforesaid procedure was given practical effect at the\\n\\nsecond meeting of the Board, held on April 23, 1941, when it\\n\\nwas agreed to invite representatives of the coffee trade to\\n\\nappear before the. Board to express their views regarding cer- tain problems which had arisen at that time. Pursuant to\\n\\nthis proposal, a committee of three trade representatives ap- peared before the Board at its meeting of May 8, 1941 and\\n\\npresented a written statement of their views regarding certain\\n\\npending problems. There ensued a discussion of the points\\n\\nat issue, which was followed by the making of arrangements\\n\\nfor a subsequent meeting between the same trade represen- tatives and the Executive Committee of the Board. At the\\n\\nfollowing meeting of the Board, on May 21, 1941, the Chair- man of the Executive Committee reported on the discussion\\n\\nheld with the trade representatives, and following further\\n\\ndiscussions the Board approved certain statements setting\\n\\n', '\\n\\nforth its policy in the matters under discussion (Appendices\\n\\nNos. 5 and 6 regarding, respectively, arrivals of coffee in ex- cess of quotas, and diverted shipments).\\n\\nLater in the year, under date of July 9, 1941, the Presi- dent of the National Coffee Association addressed a telegram\\n\\nto the Chairman of the Inter-American Coffee Board citing\\n\\ncertain cases in which, it was alleged, the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement was not being properly administered by\\n\\nthe participating countries (Appendix No. 12). This tele- gram was acknowledged by a letter from the Board dated\\n\\nJuly 18, 1941, replying in detail to the allegations advanced\\n\\nby the National Coffee Association, and establishing the\\n\\nbasis for continued cooperation. Since that time relations\\n\\nbetween the Inter-American Coffee Board and the National\\n\\nCoffee Association, as well as other trade groups in the United\\n\\nStates, have been characterized by the utmost cordiality.\\n\\nSuch problems as have arisen have referred rather to indivi- dual cases in .particular countries, rather than involving any\\n\\nbroad criticism of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement as\\n\\nsuch, or its administration by the Board.\\n\\nConcrete evidence of the results of the foregoing policy\\n\\nis to be found in the support given to the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement and its administration at the Annual\\n\\nConventions of the National Coffee Association held in\\n\\nSeptember 1941 and September 1942. An important con- tribution to the good relationships which have so far existed\\n\\nbetween the United States trade and the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board was the Declaration of Principles approved by\\n\\nthe Board on September 17, 1942 and formally enunciated\\n\\nbefore the National Coffee Association at its Annual Con- vention of September 1942 (Appendix No. 37).\\n\\n', '\\n\\n8.Diverted shipments.\\n\\nOne of the most troublesome problems confronted by\\n\\nthe Inter-American Coffee Board during the first months of\\n\\nits existence was brought about by the difficulty encountered\\n\\nby producing countries in controlling the ultimate destination\\n\\nof coffee exports. Under the terms of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement coffee exports from the participating\\n\\nproducing countries fall into one of two categories: exports\\n\\ndestined for the United States market under the quotas es- tablished by Article I of the Agreement; and exports destined\\n\\nto the market outside the United States under the quotas\\n\\nestablished by Article II of the Agreement. For the smooth\\n\\noperation of the quota plan it was obviously necessary that\\n\\ncoffee exports destined for the market outside the United\\n\\nStates should not be diverted and imported into the United\\n\\nStates. Any such procedure would naturally have the effect\\n\\nof creating discrepancies between export and import figures,\\n\\ndisturb existing contracts between exporters and importers,\\n\\nand in general create disorderly conditions.\\n\\nThe restoration of coffee prices in the United States\\n\\nmarket brought about by the conclusion of the Inter-Ameri- can Coffee Agreement provided an apparent incentive to cof- fee traders to purchase coffee in producing countries under\\n\\nArticle II of the Agreement, and then subsequently divert\\n\\nit to the United States market for entry under the quotas\\n\\nestablished by Article I. In this way coffee could be pur- chased cheaply and subsequently sold at the relatively higher\\n\\nprices in the United States market.\\n\\nA few cases of diverted shipments of this character,\\n\\nparticularly some which entered the United States from\\n\\nCanada on the West Coast, were brought to the atten\\xad\\n\\n', '\\n\\ntion of the Inter-American Coffee Board shortly after\\n\\nits inception. At its meeting of May 15, 1941, this\\n\\nproblem was discussed with representatives of the Na- tional Coffee Association, whose members had already be- come seriously alarmed because of the possible effect of such\\n\\ndiverted shipments on their normal business. On May 15 the\\n\\nBoard issued a public statement condemning this practice,\\n\\nand stating that it proposed to take effective measures to\\n\\nput an end to it, in cooperation with the Governments of the\\n\\ncountries participating in the Agreement (Appendix No. 6).\\n\\nThis warning, while clear-cut and vigorous, was not sufficient\\n\\nin itself to settle the problem once and for all, and it became\\n\\napparent that enforcement measures within the producing\\n\\ncountries alone were inadequate to control the situation ef- fectively. Accordingly, at its meeting of August 26, 1941,\\n\\nthe Board approved a resolution requesting the Government\\n\\nof the United States to limit coffee imports to shipments\\n\\ncovered by an export certificate issued by the producing\\n\\ncountry showing that the coffee was destined for the United\\n\\nStates market (Appendix No. 18).\\n\\nShortly thereafter, on September 18, 1941, the United\\n\\nStates Government issued an Executive Order giving full\\n\\neffect to the Board’s recommendation, and since that time\\n\\nthere has been no recurrence of the problem.\\n\\n9. Minimum prices.\\n\\nAs was anticipated, the successful negotiation of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement had the effect of bring- ing about a restoration of the price of coffee in the United\\n\\nStates from the ruinous levels of 1939-1940. This firmness\\n\\nin the market commenced toward the end of 1940, when it\\n\\nbecame more and more apparent that the negotiations which\\n\\n', '\\n\\nhad been carried on earlier in the year actually gave promise\\n\\nof reaching concrete and effective results. This price rise\\n\\ncontinued steadily untd August of 1941.\\n\\nIt was naturally the desire of all Governments participat- ing in the Inter-American Coffee Agreement that the bene- fits derived from this improvement in the coffee market be\\n\\ndistr^uted widely among producers, and not enjoyed solely\\n\\nby exporters and importers. With a view to assisting in the\\n\\naccomplishment of this objective; certain countries adopted\\n\\na system of minimum prices within their countries, in order\\n\\nthat all coffee producers might be guaranteed a fair selling\\n\\nprice for their product. Sales for export below such estab- lished prices were to be forbidden.\\n\\nThe development of this system of minimum prices in\\n\\nsome producing countries coincided with the rise in market\\n\\nprices referred to above, and was considered by many peo- ple as being a contributing factor in the rise. This circum- stance, combined with an acute market situation in the\\n\\nUnited States in the middle months of 1941, provoked lengthy\\n\\ndiscussions at meetings of the Board during that time, in an\\n\\neffort to work out a satisfactory procedure which would not\\n\\nonly protect the legitimate interests of producers, but like- wise avoid market disturbances and promote the orderly sale\\n\\nof coffee. The advantages and disadvantages of the minimum\\n\\nprice system, from the standpoint of international trade,\\n\\nwere discussed at some length, particularly at the meeting of\\n\\nAugust 26, 1941. Finally, on October 23, 1941, the Board\\n\\napproved a statement expressing its policy in regard to this\\n\\nimportant matter (Appendix No. 19). This statement pro- vided that, while some producing countries had deemed it\\n\\ndesirable as a measure of internal administration to establish\\n\\n', '\\n\\nminimum prices for the protection of coffee producers, the\\n\\nBoard believed that such minimum prices should not prevent\\n\\nnormal market fluctuations nor disturb the usual and normal\\n\\noperation of the coffee trade.\\n\\n10. Maximum prices.\\n\\nDuring the period of rising coffee prices experienced dur- ing the initial period of the operation of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement the United States refrained from estab- lishing maximum prices on green coffee, in the belief that the\\n\\nproblems which gave rise to a discussion of this possibility\\n\\nmight preferably be worked out by the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board in its administration of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement. This was accomplished satisfactorily to\\n\\nall concerned. However, when the attack on Pearl Harbor\\n\\non December 7, 1941 involved the United States in a major\\n\\nwar, the situation abruptly changed. The immediate pros- pect of shipping shortages threatened to cause coffee prices\\n\\nto soar to speculative levels and become an inflationary factor\\n\\nin the national economy. In these circumstances the United\\n\\nStates Office of Price Administration promptly established\\n\\nmaximum prices on green coffee in the United States, freez- ing such prices as they existed on December 8, 1941. This\\n\\nnew development was naturally of vital interest to the Inter- American Coffee Board, and was discussed at length at its\\n\\nmeeting of December 18, 1941. In the course of that meet- ing a resolution was approved (Appendix No. 22) setting\\n\\nforth the Board’s interest in the matter and its desire to\\n\\nestablish contact with the responsible authorities of the United\\n\\nStates Government in order to study the new situation.\\n\\nPursuant to this resolution representatives of the Board met\\n\\nwith representatives of the Office of Price Administration and\\n\\npresented the Board’s views to those officials. Following these\\n\\n', '\\n\\ndiscussions the Office of Price Administration submitted to\\n\\nthe Board a statement commenting on the various aspects of\\n\\nthe matter which had been discussed (Appendix No. 23). A\\n\\nmutually satisfactory procedure was adopted, whereby dif- ferentials between the various grades and types of green\\n\\ncoffee were established by an impartial committee represent- ing all branches of the coffee trade and industry in the United\\n\\nStates, and on the basis of these differentials a revised price\\n\\norder was issued on December 27, 1941, which took into ac- count the interests of producing countries. Simultaneously\\n\\nwith the announcement of the revised price schedule on\\n\\ngreen coffee the Board issued a statement, likewise dated\\n\\nDecember 27, 1941, expressing its belief that the revised\\n\\nprice schedule established a sound basis for trading in coffee\\n\\nunder existing conditions.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the maximum prices estab- lished by the Office of Price Administration in no sense rep- resented official judgment as to the relative qualities and\\n\\nvalues of different types of coffee. The price schedule mere- ly froze existing prices, on a basis of price differentials recog- nized and accepted by the coffee trade.\\n\\n11. Export certificates.\\n\\nClosely related to the problem of diverted shipments,\\n\\ndiscussed above under section 8 of this Report, is the pro- cedure whereby each producing country issues export certi- ficates covering each shipment of coffee. This procedure is\\n\\nrequired by Article VI of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, which reads as follows:\\n\\n**Each producing country participating in this Agree- ment shall take all measures necessary on its part for the\\n\\n', '\\n\\nexecution and operation of this Agreement and shall issue\\n\\nfor each coffee shipment an official document certifying\\n\\nthat the shipment is within the corresponding quota fixed\\n\\nin accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.”\\n\\nThe importance of this required procedure was brought\\n\\nto the attention of the Board at its meeting with representa- tives of the National Coffee Association ^ held on May 8,\\n\\n1941, in the course of which its relationship to the problem of\\n\\ndiverted shipments was fully discussed. There ensued during\\n\\nthe following meetings of the Board a discussion as to the\\n\\nproper form for such a certificate, and finally, on July 17,\\n\\n1941, a standard form of export certificate was approved by\\n\\nthe Board (Appendix No. 14).\\n\\nWhile the procedure for the issue of export certificates\\n\\nwas thereby clearly established, certain difficulties arose in the\\n\\nadministration of the quotas due to the fact that in a few\\n\\ncases export certificates were issued in an amount in excess\\n\\nof the corresponding quota. This circumstance naturally oc- casioned confusion and inconvenience to exporters and im- porters, and the Board received complaints in regard to the\\n\\nmatter. With a view to clarifying the Board’s position and\\n\\npolicy in the matter a formal statement was approved on\\n\\nAugust 5, 1942 regarding the obligations imposed by Article\\n\\nVI of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement and the im- portance of exercising care in the issue of export certificates\\n\\n(Appendix No. 35). The Board believes that with the ex- perience so far gained administrative control will be per- fected and the problem disappear. This is important not\\n\\nonly with respect to shipments to the United States market,\\n\\nbut likewise with regard to shipments to the market outside\\n\\nthe United States, in order to achieve effective control of the\\n\\nquotas established by Article II of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement.\\n\\n12. Unfilled quotas.\\n\\nThe third paragraph of Article IV of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement reads as follows:\\n\\n\"If any producing country participating in this\\n\\nAgreement has exported in any quota year less than its\\n\\nquota for the United States market, the Board may increase\\n\\nthat country’s quota for the immediately following\\n\\nquota year by an amount equal to the deficiency for the\\n\\npreceding quota year, up to the limit of 10 percent of the\\n\\nquota for such previous year.”\\n\\nUnder the authority conferred by the aforesaid section\\n\\nof Article IV, the Board approved a resolution on July 1,\\n\\n1941 authorizing those countries which might fail to fill\\n\\ntheir quotas for the current quota year to add to their respec- tive quotas for the following year the amount of the defi- ciency up to the limit of 10% of their quotas for the\\n\\npreceding year. (Apendix No. 11.) The effect of this\\n\\nresolution was that the quotas for certain countries during\\n\\nthe 1941-42 quota year were greater than they otherwise\\n\\nwould have been, due to the fact that those same countries\\n\\nhad not exported the full amount of their quotas during the\\n\\n1940-41 quota year.\\n\\nA proposal in the same sense was submitted to the Board\\n\\nat its meeting of September 17, 1942, with a view to having\\n\\nsimilar action taken once more. This time, however, con- ditions were materially different due to the unforeseen ship- ping difficulties encountered by some producing countries and\\n\\n', '\\n\\nthe relatively favorable shipping facilities enjoyed by others.\\n\\nNo decision was reached at the meeting of September 17 be- cause of the different conditions prevailing and the opposi- tion to such a measure which was manifested in the course of\\n\\nthe meeting. At the same time, it was agreed that if any\\n\\naction were to be taken by the Board it should be taken dur- ing the course of the current quota year, in order that there\\n\\nshould be no uncertainty during the coming quota year as\\n\\nto the actual amounts of the quotas which the different coun- tries would enjoy. Accordingly, a meeting of the Board was\\n\\ncalled on September 29, 1942, the day before the end of the\\n\\nquota year, to consider the matter again and reach a final con- clusion. Notwithstanding the abnormal shipping conditions\\n\\nthen prevailing, the Board approved a resolution on that\\n\\ndate identical to the one approved on July 1, 1941 for the\\n\\nprevious quota year (Apendix No. 38).\\n\\nIn its discussion of this problem, and the exercise by the\\n\\nBoard of the authority contained in the aforesaid section of\\n\\nArticle IV, it should be recorded that the general attitude of\\n\\nthe Delegates was to the effect that in normal times that\\n\\nprovision of the Agreement should be applied by affirmative\\n\\nresolution of the Board, to compensate producing countries\\n\\nfor any quota deficiencies due to unfavorable weather condi- tions, bad crops, and similar natural phenomena. At the\\n\\nsame time, the Board did not feel that this authority should\\n\\nbe exercised in an automatic way every year, and felt that if\\n\\nabnormal shipping conditions were to continue during the\\n\\ncoming quota year it would perhaps be more equitable to all\\n\\ncountries to refrain from taking such action, so as to avoid\\n\\ntoo great a distortion of the normal participation of each\\n\\ncountry in the United States market.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n13. Samples,\\n\\nIn July 1941 the Inter-American Coffee Board received\\n\\ncomplaints from the trade regarding the difficulties encoun- tered by exporters and importers in entering samples of cof- fee into the United States in cases where the quota corres- ponding to the particular growth of coffee had been closed.\\n\\nAfter some discussion of the matter the Board reached the\\n\\nconclusion that the operation of the quota system was not\\n\\nintended to interfere with normal trade practices, such as the\\n\\nentry of samples, and that accordingly bona fide samples for\\n\\ncommercial purposes should be permitted entry even in cases\\n\\nwhere the corresponding quota had been j&lled. The posi- tion taken by the Inter-American Coffee Board in this mat- ter was summarized in its statement of July 24, 1941 (Ap- pendix No. 15). Shortly thereafter the United States Gov- ernment issued an Executive Order providing for the entry\\n\\nof samples in line with the Board’s recommendation.\\n\\n14. Market outside the United States.\\n\\nArticle II of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\nestablishes basic annual quotas for the exportation of coffee to\\n\\nthe market outside the United States. The second para- graph of Article III grants the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nauthority to increase or decrease the export quotas for the\\n\\nmarket outside the United States to the extent that the Board\\n\\ndeems necessary to adjust supplies to estimated requirements.\\n\\nDuring the first two quota years the Board has taken\\n\\nno action in adjusting the quotas established under Article II\\n\\nfor the market outside the United States. Due to war con- ditions coffee exports to Europe were drastically curtailed,\\n\\nalthough a small volume of business was possible with cer-\\n\\n', '\\n\\ntain neutral countries in Europe in addition to exports to\\n\\nCanada and southern South America. Because of the rela- tive unimportance of the market outside the United States\\n\\nduring this period the Board took no action with regard to\\n\\nthe quotas for that market, which accordingly had no effect\\n\\non exportations.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, certain problems which\\n\\narose during the period under review led the Board to consider\\n\\nthe possibility of taking action under Articles II and III on\\n\\nvarious occasions. The main reason for the Board giving con- sideration to this matter was the fact that coffee prices within\\n\\nthe United States increased more rapidly under the opera- tion of the Agreement than prices in the market outside the\\n\\nUnited States, thereby establishing a price differential be- tween the two markets. The Board considered this to be an\\n\\nundesirable situation, from the standpoint of the producing\\n\\ncountries as well as that of the United States. As early as\\n\\nthe first meeting of the Inter-American Coffee Board specific\\n\\nproposals for dealing with this problem were advanced by one\\n\\nof the Delegates.\\n\\nAt subsequent meetings the possibility of taking action\\n\\nimder Articles II and III was discussed further and on Septem- ber 3, 1941 the Board gave its consideration to a draft resolu- tion providing for an adjustment of the quotas for the market\\n\\noutside the United States. This problem continued to engage\\n\\nthe attention of the Board from time to time, and was debated\\n\\nat some length at the Board’s meeting of March 5, 1942.\\n\\nHowever, as indicated above, no action was taken.\\n\\nAs will be seen from the foregoing resume, the problem\\n\\nof adjusting the quotas for the market outside the United\\n\\nStates did not assume great importance during the first two\\n\\n', '\\n\\nquota years, due primarily to war conditions. Nevertheless,\\n\\nwith the restoration of more normal conditions in the world\\n\\ncoffee trade it is possible that the powers and duties corre- sponding to the Board under Articles II and III of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement may assume much greater im- portance. The many discussions which the Board has already\\n\\nhad on this problem have been useful in preparing the Board\\n\\nfor adequate consideration in the future of this important\\n\\nfactor in world coffee marketing conditions.\\n\\n15. Nomignatory countries.\\n\\nAn essential feature of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment is the undertaking on the part of the United States\\n\\nGovernment to limit the importation of coffee from countries\\n\\nnot participating in the Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\nto the basic annual quota established in Article VII of the\\n\\nAgreement. This quota is automatically increased or de- creased by the same proportion and at the same time as the\\n\\nglobal quota of the participating countries for the United\\n\\nStates market.\\n\\nThe amount of the basic annual quota for non-signatory\\n\\ncountries (355,000 bags of 60 kilograms) has been the sub- ject of representations made to the United States Govern- ment by the Governments of Great Britain, the Nether- lands and Belgium, on the ground that it is smaller than\\n\\njustified (see minutes of meeting No. 19, November 12,\\n\\n1941). While it is impossible during the continuation in\\n\\nforce of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement to effect any\\n\\nchange in this quota, other than following the procedure for\\n\\nmodification established by Article XXIV of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, it is probable that this question\\n\\nwill arise again when more normal conditions are restored\\n\\n', '\\n\\nin the world coffee market and in conjunction with the ques- tion of further renewal of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment. In considering this possibility the Board has likewise\\n\\ngiven some thought to the possibility of expanding the scope\\n\\nof the Inter-American Coffee Agreement to include other\\n\\nimportant producing and consuming areas, in the thought\\n\\nthat perhaps greater participation in the European market\\n\\nmight result from such negotiations. Due to the dislocations\\n\\ncaused by war conditions this possibility has not been fully\\n\\nexplored by the Board, but it is to be anticipated that during\\n\\nthe post-war period it will be the subject of serious debate.\\n\\nIn its administration of the nonsignatory quota the\\n\\nUnited States allocated that quota during the second quota\\n\\nyear among the major producing areas: British Empire ex- cept Aden and Canada; Kingdom of the Netherlands and its\\n\\npossessions; Aden, Yemen and Saudi Arabia; and other non- signatory countries. Due to the change of conditions brought\\n\\nabout by the war and the need for added flexibility it was\\n\\ndecided to discontinue this allocation among non-signatory\\n\\nproducing areas for the third quota year.\\n\\n16. Shipping facilities.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board has at all times been\\n\\nvitally concerned with the maintenance of adequate shipping\\n\\nfacilities for the movement of coffee to the United States\\n\\nmarket, and has endeavored to shape its policy in such a way\\n\\nas to derive maximum advantages from available shipping\\n\\nfacilities. Early in 1941 the importance of this problem was\\n\\nofficially recognized by the Board when it approved its first\\n\\nresolution authorizing advance shipments (see Section 5).\\n\\nThe first clause in that resolution referred to **an emergency\\n\\nsituation... due to the possible scarcity of means of transpor\\xad\\n\\n', '\\n\\ntation to the United States in the future, which might lead to\\n\\nan imminent shortage of coffee in the market of the United\\n\\nStates” (Appendix No. 8).\\n\\nIn a resolution approved by the Board on July 24, 1941\\n\\nattention was called to the vital importance of coffee in inter- American trade and the national economies of the producing\\n\\ncountries, and the United States Government was urged to\\n\\nexert every effort to provide shipping facilities for the move- ment of coffee to the United States. On October 23, 1941\\n\\nthe Board again authorized advance shipments in order to take\\n\\nadvantage of all available shipping facilities, and later, on\\n\\nApril 29, 1942, approved a resolution removing any restric- tion on such advance shipments (Appendix No. 30).\\n\\nIn addition to the aforesaid authorization of advance\\n\\nshipments the Board has likewise adjusted the quotas for the\\n\\nUnited States market in such a way as to remove any obstacle\\n\\nwhich might otherwise be imposed on the shipment of coffee\\n\\nto the United States. It was essentially the shipping problem\\n\\nwhich motivated the Board’s resolution of July 15, 1942,\\n\\nauthorizing an emergency increase of the quotas for the\\n\\nUnited States market (Appendix No. 33). The effect of\\n\\nthis resolution was to enable those countries enjoying shipping\\n\\nfacilities to take full advantage of them, so as to ship to the\\n\\nUnited States for immediate consumption as much coffee\\n\\nas possible.\\n\\nWith a view to exploring all possibilities for improving\\n\\nthe means of maritime transportation between coffee-produc- ing countries and the United States the Chairman of the\\n\\nBoard requested the Delegates, on March 9, 1942, to investi- gate conditions in their respective countries with a view to\\n\\nmaking available sailing vessels or other small craft which\\n\\n', '\\n\\nmight be used advantageously in the coffee trade. The same\\n\\npossibility was considered later by the Delegates on July 22,\\n\\n1942, and in several countries action was initiated looking to- ward the full utilization of small boats as a means of supple- menting the normal services for coffee shipments which by\\n\\nthat time had been seriously curtailed.\\n\\nIn line with its policy of taking full advantage of all\\n\\navailable shipping space, the Board undertook to urge the\\n\\nremoval of the usual restrictions imposed by the shipping\\n\\nconferences on the shipment of coffee in non-conference\\n\\nvessels. Under date of March 12, 1942 a letter was ad- dressed to the United States War Shipping Administration\\n\\ncalling attention to this problem, and favorable action in the\\n\\nmatter was promptly taken by the War Shipping Adminis- tration, as indicated in its reply of March 21, 1942 (Ap- pendices Nos. 27 and 28).\\n\\nAt the end of the period under review maritime trans- portation between the coffee-producing countries and the\\n\\nUnited States had been seriously affected by war conditions,\\n\\nboth through the loss of tonnage as the result of submarine\\n\\nactivity and the diversion of ships to services more directly\\n\\nrelated to the war effort. The foregoing brief summary\\n\\nof the Board’s activities in relation to the shipping problem\\n\\nwill indicate that every effort was made to achieve the\\n\\nmaximum flexibility in its administration of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement so as to take full advantage of\\n\\nall available tonnage.\\n\\n17.Wartime regulations in the United States,\\n\\nThe entry of the United States into the war against the\\n\\nAxis Powers brought about a series of events having profound\\n\\n', '\\n\\neffects on the marketing of coffee, and greatly complicating\\n\\nthe task of the Inter-American Coffee Board in its adminis- tration of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\nFor the purposes of the present Report it is unnecessary\\n\\nand impracticable to go into detail regarding the many laws,\\n\\nregulations and administrative procedures adopted by the\\n\\nUnited States in order to adjust its import trade to the new\\n\\nrequirements of wartime conditions. However, a resume of\\n\\nthe more important of these regulations as they affected the\\n\\nimportation of coffee, with reference to the action taken\\n\\nby the Board in an effort to avoid unnecessary difficulties and\\n\\nto harmonize all elements in the situation, cannot properly be\\n\\nexcluded from this Report.\\n\\nImmediately after Pearl Harbor the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration of the United States found it necessary to\\n\\nestablish maximum prices on coffee in or^er to terminate the\\n\\ninflationary tendency which had already manifested itself, by\\n\\nfreezing prices at their December 8 levels.\\n\\nThis development and the action taken by the Board\\n\\nin an attempt to reconcile all interests concerned, are de- scribed in more detail in another section of this Report (Sec- tion 10—^Maximum Prices).\\n\\nThe next important step taken by the United States\\n\\nGovernment as a war measure relating to coffee was the is- suance by the War Production Board of Order M-135 on\\n\\nApril 28, 1942, restricting deliveries of roasted coffee by\\n\\nroasters to 75% of their last year’s volume of business. This\\n\\naction by the War Production Board was reported to the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Board by the United States Delegate\\n\\nat the Board’s meeting of April 29, 1942. It was pointed out\\n\\n', '\\n\\nthat the sole reason for this Order was to facilitate the equit- able distribution of coffee within the United States market,\\n\\nand that the action taken by the War Production Board was\\n\\ndue solely to the falling off of shipping facilities for the im- portation of coffee and the corresponding need of spreading\\n\\navailable supplies equitably among all roasting establishments\\n\\nthroughout the United States. Information regarding the\\n\\nOrder was furnished to the Delegates through the Secretariat,\\n\\nas a matter which all producing countries could not avoid\\n\\nfollowing with the greatest interest. Later on, due to the\\n\\ncontinued difficulties of maritime transportation, the 75%\\n\\nrestriction referred to above was reduced to 65% on Septem- ber 1, 1942. This further action by the War Production\\n\\nBoard created concern both in the United States and among\\n\\nthe Delegates to the Board lest the consequent scarcity of\\n\\nroasted coffee reaching consumers might lead later on to con- sumer rationing.\\n\\nMore important from the standpoint of the coffee-pro- ducing countries was another Order of the War Production\\n\\nBoard, General Imports Order M-63, issued on June 2, 1942.\\n\\nThe effect of this Order on coffee was simply that it sub- jected all new coffee import business to licensing by the War\\n\\nProduction Board, the purpose being to control the imports\\n\\nnot only of coffee but of several hundred other commodities\\n\\nin such a way as to derive the maximum advantage from\\n\\navailable shipping space. There followed during the months\\n\\nof July, August and September a period of readjustment to\\n\\nthis new development, during which efforts were made to im- prove administrative handling of the Order and to minimize\\n\\nunnecessary inconvenience to the coffee trade, both producers\\n\\nand importers. During this period the Board was very active\\n\\nin bringing to the attention of the competent authorities of\\n\\n', '\\n\\nthe United States Government difficulties encountered by\\n\\nproducing countries in adjusting their handling of exports to\\n\\nthe new administrative requirements. In obtaining favorable\\n\\nconsideration of the many problems which necessarily arose,\\n\\nand in bringing about a better mutual comprehension of the\\n\\nrespective problems as between producers, shippers, importers\\n\\nand the responsible Governmental agencies, the Secretary- Manager of the Board rendered a valuable service to all the\\n\\nDelegates. The position of the Board throughout this period\\n\\ncan be summarized very briefly by stating that it felt that\\n\\nall available shipping space for coffee should be fully utilized,\\n\\nconsistent with the requirements of the war, and that admin- istrative procedures should be flexible enough to avoid any\\n\\nloss of space for purely administrative reasons. Continuous\\n\\ncontact with the War Production Board made this view fully\\n\\nknown to that agency, and the Board’s interest in this im- portant matter no doubt contributed greatly in minimiz- ing such difficulties as did arise. By the end of the period\\n\\nunder review the coffee trade was becoming adjusted to the\\n\\nnew requirements, administrative procedures were falling\\n\\ninto a pattern, and the Board had reason to believe that its\\n\\nlegitimate interest in the proper administration of Order\\n\\nM-63 was being given serious attention by the competent\\n\\nofficials. It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that the\\n\\nmechanism provided by the Inter-American Coffee Board for\\n\\nthe joint formulation of the views of producing countries and\\n\\ntheir official and effective presentation to the competent\\n\\nauthorities of the United States Government has been of\\n\\ntremendous advantage to all the countries participating in the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement in facilitating prompt and\\n\\neffective handling of their mutual problems.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n18.Renewal of Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\nArticle XXIV of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement\\n\\nprovides that it shall remain in force until October 1, 1943,\\n\\nsubject to certain contingencies, and that prior to October 1,\\n\\n1942 ”the Board shall make recommendations to the parti- cipating Governments as to the continuation or otherwise of\\n\\nthe Agreement”.\\n\\nIn anticipation of the discussions which the Board would\\n\\nhave to undertake in the formulation of its recommenda- tions, the Chairman called attention to the Board’s responsi- bilities in this respect at the meeting of January 6, 1942. On\\n\\nApril 29,1942 the Board approved a resolution requesting the\\n\\nparticipating Governments to transmit to the Board through\\n\\ntheir respective Delegates information regarding the need or\\n\\notherwise of resubmitting the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment to their respective legislative bodies for ratification in\\n\\nthe event that the Agreement were to be continued (Appen- dix No. 31).\\n\\nAt the meeting of the Board held on July 7, 1942 there\\n\\ncommenced formal and detailed discussions regarding all\\n\\nquestions involved in a possible continuation of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement. During six subsequent meet- ings of the Board the matter was carefully studied, and all the\\n\\nDelegates expressed their respective points of view regarding\\n\\nthis important subject. These discussions culminated in the\\n\\nformulation of a resolution approved by the Board on Sep- tember 2, 1942 recommending the continuation without\\n\\nchange of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement for a period\\n\\nof one year from October 1, 1943 (Appendix No. 36). A\\n\\ncopy of this resolution was transmitted formally by the\\n\\nChairman of the Board to each of the Governments partici\\xad\\n\\n', '\\n\\npating in the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, expressing\\n\\nthe Board’s desire to receive a reply at as early a date as con- venient. During the coming quota year, 1942-43, the Board\\n\\nwill receive replies from the various participating Govern- ments and decide on further action to take in regard to the\\n\\npossible renewal of the Agreement, piursuant to the provisions\\n\\nof Article XXIV.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nIII.

APPENDICES\\n\\n' APPENDIX No. 1\\n\\nMeeting No. 1\\n\\nApril 17, 1941\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING\\n\\nPRICES AND CONSUMPTION\\n\\nThe purpose of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement is\\n\\nto make possible the orderly marketing of coffee under the\\n\\nextraordinary conditions which have resulted from the pres- ent world conflict. These conditions aggravated an already\\n\\nserious surplus problem in coffee-producing countries and\\n\\nbrought about a decline in coffee prices to extremely low\\n\\nlevels. The Board does not believe that the continuation of\\n\\ndistress prices which threaten the economic stability and\\n\\npurchasing power of producers is in the interest of coffee con- sumers or is desired by them.\\n\\nThe Board wishes to make clear, however, that it will be\\n\\nits purpose, in the administration of the Agreement, to main- tain coffee prices at reasonable levels which will encourage\\n\\nconsumption. For the United States, which constitutes the\\n\\nlargest single market for coffee, there has been a significant\\n\\nincrease in consumption in recent years. The Board believes\\n\\nthat, with the maintenance of reasonable prices, consumption\\n\\nin the United States may be further increased and that the\\n\\nsurplus problem in producing countries may be thereby\\n\\nsubstantially alleviated. Consumers in the United States may\\n\\naccordingly be assured that their interests will be safeguarded\\n\\nunder this program of inter-American cooperation.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nMEMORANDUM REGARDING CONVERSION\\n\\nFACTORS\\n\\nThe oflScial statistics of the United States Department of\\n\\nCommerce relative to coffee imports are in pounds. The\\n\\nGovernment of the United States will convert bags of 60\\n\\nkilograms, the unit of measure specified in the Agreement, to\\n\\npounds for quota purposes at the rate of one bag equals\\n\\n132.276 pounds.\\n\\nUnder the Agreement imports of roasted coffee are in- cluded within the import quotas established by the United\\n\\nStates. Therefore it is necessary that a basis be established\\n\\nfor charging such imports to the quotas. The Government\\n\\nof the United States proposes, if the Board concurs, to use\\n\\nthe factor of 1.2 in converting imports of roasted coffee to\\n\\nthe green coffee equivalent for quota purposes. Thus quan- tities of imports of roasted coffee will be multiplied by the\\n\\nfactor 1.2. This assumes an average shrinkage in the roasting\\n\\nprocess of approximately 16 percent.\\n\\nAPPENDIX No. 2\\n\\nMeeting No. 1\\n\\nApril 17, 1941\\n\\n', '\\n\\nRESOLUTION REQUESTING STATISTICS ON SALES\\n\\nREGISTRATIONS IN PRODUCING COUNTRIES\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1. It is advisable to maintain up-to-date information on\\n\\ncoffee sales registered in the producing countries, within the\\n\\nexport quota; and\\n\\n2.

Y.,\\n\\nJuly 9, 1941.\\n\\nPaul C. Daniels, Chairman,\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Board,\\n\\n2400 16 Street, Northwest,\\n\\nWashington, D. C.\\n\\nOn behalf of the United States coffee trade I respect- fully call to your attention the following facts namely that\\n\\nfive of the governments, parties to the Inter-American Cof- fee Treaty, have failed in their obligations under the treaty\\n\\nin the following respects. Venezuela in that it permitted\\n\\nan agency wholly financed by the government to consign\\n\\nlarge quantities of coffee in the United States and that it\\n\\npermitted coffee to be exported greatly in excess of its quota\\n\\nin direct violation of Articles Four and Seventeen of the\\n\\nagreement. Guatemala in that it permitted coffee to be ex- ported in amoxmts so greatly in excess of its quota as to indi- cate a lack of serious effort to control exports as it is required\\n\\nto do under Article Four of the Agreement. Haiti in that it\\n\\ninstituted regulations which make it impossible for American\\n\\nimporters to secure coffee they have already purchased with- out paying an additional sum to Haitian exporters. This is\\n\\nviolation of Article Seventeen of the agreement. Brazil as\\n\\nis clearly indicated has permitted amounts of coffee to be\\n\\nregistered greatly in excess of its quota and has on some oc- APPENDIX No. 12\\n\\nMeeting No. 8\\n\\nJuly 9, 1941\\n\\n', \"\\n\\ncasions refused export permits of coflFee properly registered\\n\\nand has permitted its quota to be filled without regard for\\n\\ncoffees sold registered and intended for shipment in August\\n\\nand September all this in violation of Articles Six and Seven- teen of the treaty. Colombia in that it permitted coffee to\\n\\nbe shipped in excess of its quota in violation of Article Four\\n\\nof the treaty in that it failed to take measures required in\\n\\nArticle Six of the treaty. In that it did, we have reason to\\n\\nbelieve, permit a government dependency to consign coffee\\n\\nto the United States in violation of Article Seventeen and\\n\\nfinally in that it made possible a severe shortage of Colom- bian coffees on the west coast of the United States. All these\\n\\nacts of commission and omission havec caused serious disrup- tion to the trade in the United States and have caused indivi- dual importers serious and unjustified losses. In view of the\\n\\nobvious equities in the matter we believe ourselves entitled\\n\\nto request expression from the Board as to whether the Board\\n\\nhas or can secure authority to arbitrate the losses sustained\\n\\nand proved by United States importers on account of the\\n\\nfailure mentioned above and if it can secure from the gov- ernment in question authority to make adequate compensa- tion for these losses. We would like to be informed also as\\n\\nto what guarantee the Board can secure for itself and for the\\n\\ntrade of the United States that the above mentioned failures\\n\\nof compliance will not re-occur. The coffee trade has and\\n\\ndoes support the quota system as written into the treaty be- lieving it a necessary and desirable action but feels that the\\n\\nsystem cannot function under circumstances which make\\n\\ncontracts meaningless or unless the Board assumes the full\\n\\nauthority of administration assigned it under the provisions\\n\\nof the treaty. Respectfully,\\n\\nGeorge C. THreRBACH,\\n\\n'President\\n\\nNATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIATION\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nAPPENDIX No. 13\\n\\nMeeting No. 9\\n\\nJuly 17,1941\\n\\nLETTERTO THE NATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIATION\\n\\nREPLYING TO THE ASSOCIATION’S\\n\\nCOMPLAINTS\\n\\nJuly 18,1941.\\n\\nMr. George C. Thierbach, ^\\n\\nPresident, National Coffee Association,\\n\\n120 Wall Street,\\n\\nNew York, New York.\\n\\nMy dear Mr. Thierbach;\\n\\nI acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated July\\n\\n9, 1941 in which you call to the attention of the Inter- American Coffee Board, on behalf of the United States coffee\\n\\ntrade, certain alleged irregularities in the operation and ad- ministration of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Sup- plementing the Board’s preliminary acknowledgment of July\\n\\n9, a more detailed reply is now submitted regarding the\\n\\nvarious points raised in your telegram under reference.\\n\\nYou call attention to the fact that in the case of certain\\n\\ncountries exports of coffee have taken place in excess of the\\n\\ncorresponding quotas for those countries. It is unques- tionably true that in the cases you mention coffee exports\\n\\nhave in fact exceeded the quotas established for those coun- tries. It is equally true that in the case of one country en- tries of coffee into the United States for consumption dur- ing the current quota year exceeded the corresponding coffee\\n\\nquota for that country. The Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nnaturally regrets that these discrepancies have occured dur-\\n\\n', '\\n\\ning the present quota year, but feels impelled to call atten- tion to the following facts. In the first place, the Inter- American Coffee Agreement was not signed until nearly two\\n\\nmonths of the initial quota period had elapsed. Following\\n\\nsignature, the Agreement had no legal effect until such time\\n\\nas the instruments of ratification of the 15 participating\\n\\ncountries had been deposited in the Pan American Union, or\\n\\nuntil such time as it had been brought into effect by means\\n\\nof a protocol for the purpose as provided in Article XX. It\\n\\nwas not until April 15, 1941, or after more than one-half\\n\\nof the current quota year had elapsed, that the Inter- American Coffee Agreement became legally effective. Up\\n\\nuntil that date there was a lack of complete assurance in\\n\\neach of the 15 coimtries that the Agreement would in fact\\n\\nbecome effective, and it was correspondingly difficult for\\n\\neach of the 15 countries to perfect its laws, regulations and\\n\\nadministrative procedure in such a way as to harmonize with\\n\\nthe new and unprecedented coffee program established under\\n\\nthe terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Not- withstanding this difficulty, efforts were made in each of the\\n\\ncountries to anticipate the situation and to prepare for ade- quate means for discharging their obligations under the treaty.\\n\\nWhile the initial steps taken did not prove to be adequate in\\n\\nall cases, the experience received during the last few months\\n\\nhas been valuable and the Board is confident that each\\n\\nparticipating country is giving serious attention to the mat- ter in an effort to perfect its regulations and avoid a recur- rence of the difficulties brought about by exports in excess\\n\\nof the established quotas. The Board has received no evidence\\n\\nof any intention on the part of any participating government\\n\\ndeliberately to violate the terms of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement; rather, there is no doubt that the government\\n\\nof each producing country intends to take all appropriate\\n\\n', '\\n\\nmeasures with a view to preventing in the future exports\\n\\nof coffee in excess of the duly established quotas.\\n\\nA somewhat similar problem has arisen by virtue of the\\n\\nfact that in at least one case there is evidence to indicate that\\n\\nregistrations of sales of coffee for future delivery have been\\n\\npermitted in excess of the corresponding quota. The same\\n\\ngeneral considerations set forth above in the preceding\\n\\npa**agraph apply likewise to this matter. There is ample\\n\\nevidence to indicate that neither the country in question,\\n\\nnor any other country, intends to permit a recurrence of this\\n\\ndifficidty during the coming quota year or at any time in\\n\\nthe future. Furthermore, the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nis undertaking the compilation of registration figures from\\n\\neach of the producing countries, has approved a standard\\n\\nform for submitting this information on a weekly basis, and\\n\\nbelieves that its efforts in this direction, together with im- proved regulations in the exporting countries, will make a\\n\\nrepetition of the problem extremely unlikely.\\n\\nProtest is made in your telegram under reference against\\n\\nthe consignment of coffee in the United States by govern- mental agencies or dependencies. Although the Board has\\n\\nnot received very detailed information or evidence on this\\n\\npoint, it has agreed as a matter of policy that governmental\\n\\nconsignments of this character should be discouraged or\\n\\nprohibited by each of the participating governments in order\\n\\nto maintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual op- eration of the coffee trade. It should be pointed out, how- ever, that governmental consignments of this character may\\n\\nwell have occurred prior to the entry into force of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and accordingly constitute a\\n\\nproblem for the trade which might exist in the absence of a\\n\\nquota agreement.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nThere are enclosed statements submitted by the dele- gates of Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala discussing their\\n\\nindividual problems in more detail.\\n\\nReference is made in your telegram to the effect that\\n\\nregulations have been instituted in one of the participating\\n\\ncountries *Vhich make it impossible for American importers\\n\\nto secure coffee they have already purchased without paying\\n\\nan additional sum to . . . exporters”. The Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board states categorically that it is definitely opposed\\n\\nto any regulations in any of the countries participating in the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement which might have the\\n\\neffect of nullifying contracts entered into in good faith. The\\n\\nBoard believes that the sanctity of contracts in commercial\\n\\ndealings must be upheld at all costs; that the contract system\\n\\nprovides a useful method for handling the coffee business,\\n\\nwith benefits for producers, distributors and consumers\\n\\nalike. Accordingly, the Board desires to be informed of any\\n\\ncase where a contract entered into in good faith is nullified\\n\\nretroactively by official act. In the case cited in your tele- gram under reference, it is understood that the regulations\\n\\nin question do not prevent compliance with previously\\n\\nexisting contracts.\\n\\nThe present situation on the West Coast of the United\\n\\nStates due to the inability of importers to obtain delivery\\n\\non certain coffees which have been previously purchased,\\n\\nentry of which is prohibited by the closing of the quotas,\\n\\nis currently being considered by the Board in an effort to\\n\\ndetermine what action, if any, should be taken by the Board.\\n\\nIt is naturally desired that all reasonable and appropriate\\n\\nsteps be taken to avoid undue hardship on the part of any\\n\\nsingle individual or firm in the coffee trade of the United\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nStates; at the same time, the Board cannot help but feel a\\n\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement on a stable basis, and its operation in an\\n\\nimpartial, non-discriminatory manner for the protection\\n\\nof the coffee trade as a whole.\\n\\nYou inquire *'as to whether the Board has or can secure\\n\\nauthority to arbitrate the losses sustained^ and proved by\\n\\nUnited States importers”. Without entering into a discus- sion of whether the Board has or has not authority to act as\\n\\narbitrator for losses sustained in such cases, it may be stated\\n\\nthat in the opinion of the Board it would be of doubtful\\n\\nvalue for it to undertake the arbitration of disputes arising\\n\\nfrom losses. In certain cases resort to arbitration by a quali- fied arbitrator or group of arbitrators may provide the most\\n\\nexpedient manner for settling current problems; but it is not\\n\\nbelieved that the Inter-American Coffee Board would provide\\n\\na suitable means for this procedure at the present time. The\\n\\nBoard hopes, however, that it will be found possible for the\\n\\nparties at interest to work out a mutually satisfactory and\\n\\nequitable settlement.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board has noted with pleas- ure your statement that the coffee trade has supported and\\n\\ndoes support the quota system as written into the treaty. It\\n\\nagrees that the system cannot function under circumstances\\n\\nwhich make contracts meaningless. It is confident, as set\\n\\nforth above, that the problems which you have specified are\\n\\nessentially problems of transition, due primarily to the in- auguration of a vast and unprecedented control system re- quiring complete cooperation by 15 countries and presenting\\n\\na new set of circumstances for the operation of the coffee\\n\\ntrade. There is every reason to believe that the period of\\n\\nreadjustment to new conditions has largely been passed, and\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nthat there will be no recurrence of any of the problems listed\\n\\nin your telegram of July 9.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board is attempting to dis- charge its obligations in a thorough and impartial manner.\\n\\nIt has already taken many constructive steps which have been\\n\\nduly made known to the trade and the public. Its work is\\n\\nonly beginning. It welcomes constructive suggestions from\\n\\nall sources. Accordingly, if the National Coffee Association,\\n\\nor any other organization or individual in the United States\\n\\nhaving an interest in the coffee situation, has any specific sug- gestions as to any acts of commission or omission by the Inter- American Coffee Board, I can assure you that they will be\\n\\ngiven very careful attention by the Board. A cooperative\\n\\nattitude and a mutual understanding of each other’s problems\\n\\nand difficulties will go far towards eliminating the rough\\n\\nspots.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nPaul C. Daniels, Chairman.\\n\\nEnclosures:\\n\\nThree memoranda.\\n\\nEnclosure No. 1\\n\\n(TRANSLATION)\\n\\nNATIONAL COFFEE DEPARTMENT OF BRAZIL\\n\\n120 Wall Street\\n\\nNew York, N.Y.\\n\\nThe charges filed by the National Coffee Association\\n\\nagainst the National Coffee Department of Brazil are with- out foundation due to the following reasons:\\n\\n180]\\n\\n1. The excess (of less than 5% of our quota) in the\\n\\nregistration of sales for the first year of the agreement\\n\\nwas caused by our inability to obtain proper informa- tion at this end, such as classification of arrivals by ships\\n\\nand dates of entry into territories under American\\n\\njurisdiction. Therefore, not knowing the details per- taining to coffee shipments fulfilling the Brazilian quota\\n\\nunder the agreement, we were unable to determine (as\\n\\nwe still are, notwithstanding our request to the Inter- American Coffee Board) exactly when to stop registra- tion of coffee for this year’s quota. Such data was in- dispensable for rigid control of the first year’s quota,\\n\\ndue to the fact that the agreement signed in November\\n\\nincluded coffee already shipped from Brazil in Septem- ber, over which naturally we could not have had con- trol as is required under the terms of the Agreement;\\n\\n2. It is very likely that such circumstances and similar\\n\\nconditions were foreseen when the Agreement was\\n\\nsigned, since Article IV admitted the possibility of an\\n\\nexcess shipment and provided for such an excess to be\\n\\ndeducted from the next year’s quota;\\n\\n3. Furthermore, until the Agreement had been effectively\\n\\nratified by all the signatory countries it would be under- standable that we could not undertake all the neces- sary precuationary measures against such an excess, since\\n\\nit would have been against the interests of Brazil, in the\\n\\nevent that the Agreement were not put into effect.\\n\\nHowever, disregarding such possibilities, we closed the\\n\\nregistration of sales for the first year under the quota\\n\\non March 21, 1941, as stated in the communication of\\n\\nthe National Coffee Department of Brazil, released on\\n\\n', '\\n\\n/\\n\\nMarch 22,1941, which was quite some time prior to the\\n\\ninstallation of the Inter-American Coffee Board, and be- fore the United States Government was legally able to\\n\\ntake the necessary steps for the control of coffee ship- ments entering this country under the provisions of the\\n\\nAgreement;\\n\\n4. We should add that the “shipment certificate” which is\\n\\nreferred to in Article VI of the Agreement, and which\\n\\nis indispensable for the identification of coffee ship- ments from each country, is, up to the present date,\\n\\nbeing enforced by Brazil only, and has not yet been\\n\\nconsidered by the United States Customs;\\n\\n5. There are no grounds for the statement that we have\\n\\nrefused permits for shipments of coffee properly regis- tered, and these facts may easily be verified by anyone\\n\\nwho is famiiliar with the coffee and exchange regula- tions of Brazil;\\n\\n6. In truth, what we have not allowed is the advance ship- ments of coffee which were registered for August and\\n\\nSeptember. This, however, is a matter pertaining to our\\n\\ndomestic economy and has no bearing on the terms of\\n\\nthe Agreement. Therefore, contrary to the charges\\n\\nbrought against us, we feel that we have given ample\\n\\nproof of our desire to fulfill all the terms of the Agree- ment, ^ shown for instance by the fact that although\\n\\ndisposing of a quota of 9,765,000 bags we have allocated\\n\\nto the exporters only 9,300,000 bags, thus compensating\\n\\nfor the small excess in the first year.\\n\\n(Sgd.) E. Penteado.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nEnclosure No. 2\\n\\n(TRANSLATION)\\n\\nMEMORANDUM PRESENTED BY THE DELEGATE\\n\\nOF COLOMBIA\\n\\nIn the telegram addressed by the President of the Na- tional Coffee Association to the Chairman of the Inter- American Coffee Board it is stated, among other allegations\\n\\nmade to the countries signatory to the Inter-American Cof- fee Agreement, that Colombia has failed in fulfilling the\\n\\nobhgations imposed on it by the said treaty in respect of the\\n\\nfollowing points:\\n\\n1. For having permitted the shipment of coffee in excess\\n\\nof her quota, which constitutes a violation of Article IV of\\n\\nthe Treaty. This afBrmation has been made by the National\\n\\nCoffee Association without possessing official proofs of any\\n\\nkind to support it, since the fact that arrivals of Colombian\\n\\ncoffee in the United States during the quota year have ex- ceeded the quota fixed for Colombia, does not imply that that\\n\\ncountry permitted the registration of exports in excess of\\n\\nher quota; on the contrary, the information possessed by the\\n\\nColombian Delegate indicates that the respective official en- tities there took the greatest care and that there was exer- cised a strict supervision of registrations, which were suspend- ed when the quota was filled. What appears to have occurred\\n\\nis that subsequent to last October 1, there entered the United\\n\\nStates shipments of Colombian coffee which had left Colom- bia prior to that date, as seems to be the case with reference\\n\\nto coffee from the region of Cucuta which was shipped from\\n\\nVenezuela and which, it is understood, is held by the owners\\n\\nto be aged in that country for some time past; furthermore,\\n\\nas the statistics clearly show, it is understood that a good\\n\\n', '\\n\\npart of the shipments registered in Colombia and destined\\n\\nfor Canada were held in this country by local importers,\\n\\nmembers of the coffee trade of the United States. How can\\n\\nColombia be held responsible for these occurrences, which\\n\\nwere entirely beyond her control, and how, on the basis of\\n\\nimportations which had this origin, can the totally unfounded\\n\\nallegation be made that Columbia has violated Article IV? In\\n\\nfact. Article IV treats of \"unforeseen circumstances” and\\n\\ncontemplates the case that the export quota of a given coun- try for the United States may be exceeded during the quota\\n\\nyear, and it is necessary to consider as cases of this character\\n\\nthose which have just been noted.\\n\\n2. It is alleged that Colombia failed in its obligation to\\n\\ntake the measures required by Article VI of the Treaty. That\\n\\nallegation is really surprising, to say the least, since everybody\\n\\nknows that Colombia was the first country which hastened on\\n\\nNovember 22, even before signing the Treaty, to take internal\\n\\nmeasures of various kinds tending to establish an adequate\\n\\ncontrol of the sales and exportation of coffee, precisely with\\n\\nthe purpose of avoiding difficulties which might arise in the\\n\\noperation of the Pact. The certificate referred to in Article\\n\\nVI is only now being discussed by the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard and even in the event that Colombia had issued it, in no\\n\\nway would the difficulties have been avoided which the lack\\n\\nof the certificate would have caused the coffee trade of the\\n\\nUnited States, since the United States had no legislation per- mitting the Custom houses to refuse entry to coffees not\\n\\ncovered by the said certificate.\\n\\n3. It is alleged that the Association has reasons to believe\\n\\nthat Colombia permitted a dependency of the Government\\n\\nto consign coffee to the United States in violation of Article\\n\\nXVII. In this case the Association limits itself to gathering\\n\\n', '\\n\\nrumors and therefore, since it barely has \"reasons to believe”\\n\\nthat the said Article has been violated, it would be desirable\\n\\nif concrete proofs would be presented in this respect setting\\n\\nforth in what form there has been violation of Article XVII,\\n\\nwhich estabhshes that the participating Governments agree\\n\\nto maintain in so far as possible the normal and usual opera- tion of the coffee trade.\\n\\n4. It is alleged that Colombia made possible an acute\\n\\nshortage of coffee on the West Coast of the United States.\\n\\nThis is another allegation made without any solid founda- tion by the National Coffee ALSSociation, since it cannot well\\n\\nbe pretended that Colombia watches over the distribution of\\n\\ncoffee so that there will not arise shortages in the different\\n\\nregions of the United States. This is beyond its control and\\n\\nis the exclusive function of the importing trade and it is not\\n\\npossible to hold the Governments responsible for shipping\\n\\ndifficulties, customs regulations, or other special circum- stances which may have prevented the trade in a given zone\\n\\nof the United States from supplying itself adequately with\\n\\ngiven types of coffee.\\n\\nColombia, then, in rejecting the charges made by the\\n\\nAssociation, manifests her firm desire to support all measures\\n\\nwhich may be necessary to strengthen the spirit and letter of\\n\\nthe Pact and to enforce strict compliance with its provisions.\\n\\n(Signed) Rafael Montoya Perez.\\n\\nJuly 16, 1941.\\n\\nEnclosure No. 3\\n\\nMEMORANDUM\\n\\nThe Delegate of Guatemala wishes to inform that he\\n\\nfinds wholly unwarranted the statements, with reference\\n\\nto Guatemala, made by Mr. George C.

Similarly, some concerns operating roasting establish- ments in Canda, who customarily examine and cup-test in\\n\\nNew York samples of coffee destined for roasting in Canada,\\n\\nhave found it difficult to continue this normal operation in\\n\\ncases where the corresponding coffee quota has been closed.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Agreement was intended to\\n\\naccomplish certain specified objectives through the estab- lishment of a quota system without interfering any more\\n\\nthan might be necessary with the usual and normal operation\\n\\nof the coffee trade. Article XVII of the Coffee Agreement,\\n\\nwhich formally establishes this principle, reads as follows:\\n\\n**The participating Governments agree to\\n\\nmaintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual\\n\\noperation of the coffee trade.”\\n\\nIn view of the clear purpose and intent of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and the fact that the quotas\\n\\nestablished therein are intended to cover only coffee entered\\n\\nfor actual consumption, the Inter-American Coffee Board ex- presses the opinion that the entry of samples for testing pur- poses may properly be considered as falling outside the scope\\n\\n', '\\n\\nAPPENDIX No. 15\\n\\nMeeting No. 10\\n\\nJuly 24, 1941\\n\\nof the quotas and accordingly may be permitted even in\\n\\ncases where the corresponding quota has been closed.\\n\\nIt is apparent that if this procedure is to be adopted ade- quate safeguards must be established by regulation in order\\n\\nto prevent abuses. The Board is confident that practical\\n\\nmeasures of accomplishing the objective may be adopted\\n\\nwithout in any way weakening the strict enforcement of\\n\\nthe quotas.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nresolution urging MAINTENANCE OF MARI- TIME FACILITIES FOR THE SHIPMENT OF\\n\\nCOFFEE TO THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1. Coffee is the most important single commodity im- ported by the United States from the other American repub- lics, and represents one of the basic articles of consumption in\\n\\nthe United States;\\n\\n2. The economic welfare and prosperity of many of the\\n\\nAmerican republics depend in large measure on the coffee\\n\\ntrade;\\n\\n3. Under the terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment over 97% of all imports of coffee into the United\\n\\nStates come from the other American republics;\\n\\n4. The Inter-American Coffee Agreement is intended\\n\\nto stabilize the coffee market on terms fair to producers and\\n\\nconsumers alike;\\n\\n5. Uncertainties regarding the present and prospective\\n\\nshipping facilities for transporting this important commodity\\n\\nto the United States may create fear, undermine confidence\\n\\nand promote speculation, to the detriment of the announced\\n\\npurposes of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;\\n\\n6. It is the announced policy of the Government of the\\n\\nUnited States, as has been made clear in various public state- APPENDIX No. 16\\n\\nMeeting No. 10\\n\\nJuly 25, 1941\\n\\n', '\\n\\nments by ofEcials of that Government, to maintain so far as\\n\\npossible, normal maritime communications between the\\n\\nUnited States and the other American republics;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To request the Government of the United States to\\n\\nexert every effort to maintain maritime facilities for the\\n\\nmovement of coffee to the United States market in sufEcient\\n\\nvolume to fill the quotas established under the provisions of\\n\\nthe Inter-American Coffee Agreement;\\n\\n2.

The preamble of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, which sets forth in general terms the broad objectives\\n\\nof the Agreement, states that **it is necessary and desirable\\n\\nto take steps to promote the orderly marketing of coffee, with\\n\\na view to assuring terms of trade equitable for both pro- ducers and consumers by adjusting the supply to demand”;\\n\\n2. The statement by the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nof its pohcy regarding prices and consumption, dated April\\n\\n17, 1941, reiterates that ”the purpose of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement is to make possible the orderly marketing\\n\\nof coffee under the extraordinary conditions which have re- sulted from the present world conflict”;\\n\\n3. Recent developments in the coffee market of the\\n\\nUnited States, which have been caused in some measure by\\n\\nofficial acts not contemplated in the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement, threaten to disrupt orderly marketing conditions\\n\\nand the normal business of coffee roasting establishments\\n\\nthroughout the United States, and are making it difficult\\n\\nfor many of these establishments to satisfy their normal re- quirements except on terms of trade considered inequitable;\\n\\n4. Although it appears that stocks of coffee within the\\n\\nUnited States may be ample at the present time, there is\\n\\n', '\\n\\nreason to believe that these stocks are closely held, partly for\\n\\nspeculative purposes, with the result that there is a corre- sponding scarcity of coffee freely offered on equitable terms\\n\\nin the United States market;\\n\\n5. In certain individual cases roasters are confronted with\\n\\nan actual scarcity of certain types of coffee due to the fact\\n\\nthat the corresponding quotas have been closed prior to the\\n\\narrival of shipments purchased by these roasters in good faith\\n\\nfor their normal requirements during the current quota year;\\n\\n6. Article XVII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment requires the participating governments to maintain, in\\n\\nso far as possible, the normal and usual operation of the coffee\\n\\ntrade;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To increase, as of August 11, 1941, the quotas for\\n\\nthe United States market by a further increase of 20% of\\n\\nthe basic quotas, in accordance with the provisions of Article\\n\\nVIII of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;\\n\\n2.

In spite of the efforts which have been made in pro- ducing countries to check this abuse, it appears that more\\n\\neffective measures must be provided with the cooperation\\n\\nof the Government of the United States;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\nTo request the Government of the United States to\\n\\ntake such action as may be appropriate to limit the entry\\n\\nof coffee for consumption in the United States to ship- ments for which the official document provided for in Article\\n\\nVI of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement has been issued,\\n\\ncertifiying that the coffee is destined for the United States\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nSTATEMENT REGARDING MINIMUM PRICES\\n\\nAND PORT STOCKS\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board has carefully studied\\n\\nthe operation of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, and\\n\\nas a result of this study has arrived at certain conclusions\\n\\nwhich, it is believed, will contribute materially to the success- ful operation of the Agreement in the future.

On December 11, 1941 the Office of Price Adminis- tration of the United States of America, taking account of\\n\\nthe present critical emergency situation, fixed a tentative list\\n\\nof maximum prices for green coffee in the United States mar- ket, taking as a basis the prices which prevailed in New York\\n\\non December 8 of this year;\\n\\n2. The Government of the United States has invited the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Board to consider the problems\\n\\nthereby created and to contribute its views regarding the best\\n\\nmethods of dealing with them;\\n\\n3.

C.\\n\\nA.\\n\\n1. The issuance of a price order on green coffee by the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration follows directly from the duty\\n\\nof this Office of preventing any interference with the war\\n\\neffort of the United States that might arise from price in- creases. It is essential to high civilian morale that the supply\\n\\nof food be adequate and available to consumers at reasonable\\n\\nprices. Coffee is one of the most essential of foods; among\\n\\nadults it is the leading food beverage consumed in this coun- try and its stimulating character makes it especially desirable\\n\\nin times of emergency.\\n\\n2. In the last eighteen months the prices of green coffees\\n\\nhave shown very large increases, the prices of some grades\\n\\nhaving more than doubled. Although prices seemed to have\\n\\nbecome stabilized in the last month, the outbreak of the\\n\\nwar on December 7 created a situation in which the infla- tionary tendencies in the price of coffee might again be\\n\\nintensified. Therefore, in order to prevent further infla- tionary increases, the price of coffee was frozen at the\\n\\nlevels prevailing on December 8.\\n\\nAPPENDIX No. 23\\n\\nMeeting No. 21\\n\\nDecember 26, 1941\\n\\n', '\\n\\n3. Although the establishment of a price ceiling for\\n\\ncoffee was dictated by the lines of internal policy, it is clear\\n\\nthat such an action has international repercussions. It is\\n\\nclear also that it is equally to the advantage of both the\\n\\nexporting countries and the United States that the orderly\\n\\nmarketing of coffee be maintained under the ceiling order.\\n\\nThe cooperation of all parties is essential to this end, and\\n\\nit is the opinion of the Office of Price Administration that\\n\\nsuch cooperation can best be implemented by contact be- tween the Office of Price Administration and the Inter- American Coffee Board.\\n\\nB.\\n\\n4. In line with this policy representatives of the Office\\n\\nof Price Administration met with Mr. Paul Daniels, repre- senting the Inter-American Coffee Board, on December 22.\\n\\nAt this meeting Mr. Daniels presented several factors which\\n\\nthe Board felt should be considered in the revision of the\\n\\nprice schedule on green coffee. These considerations are dis- cussed in the five paragraphs immediately following.\\n\\n5. It has been suggested that the ceiling prices be based\\n\\non a fixed price f.o.b. export points. The Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration has no authority to fix prices anywhere ex- cept in this country. However, sufficient flexibility in the\\n\\nceiling price to take care of increases in freight, marine in- surance, and war risk insurance rates is desirable from sev- eral points of view. Also there is equity in the claim that\\n\\nthe producing countries should not bear the burden of such\\n\\nincreases, since these rates are beyond the control of the pro- ducing countries. With these considerations in mind, the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration has inserted in the draft of\\n\\nthe amendment to Price Schedule No. 50 (Subsection 1351.1\\n\\n(g), a copy of which has been forwarded, a provision which\\n\\nhas the effect of establishing fixed prices f.o.b. export points.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n6. Another consideration offered by the Board relates to\\n\\ncost of production. The estimation of cost of production\\n\\ndata for agricultural products is extremely difficult. How- ever, since fixed costs are such a large proportion of the\\n\\ntotal cost of production, it is hardly possible that unit costs\\n\\nof producing coffee have risen to levels that are not more\\n\\nthan covered by the current level of ceiling prices. Until\\n\\nsuch time as reliable data shows that payments to growers\\n\\nhave been increased in greater proportion than the increase\\n\\nin coffee prices, an increase in the ceiling cannot be justified\\n\\non this basis.\\n\\n7. A similar response is indicated in considering increases\\n\\nin the prices of articles imported by the producing coun- tries from the United States. The ceiling prices currently\\n\\nestablished offset by many times increases in prices of articles\\n\\nexported from the United States. From data published by\\n\\nthe United States Department of Commerce, it is found\\n\\nthat from the first half of 1940 to July, 1941 (the last date\\n\\nfor which the information is published) the prices of fin- ished manufacturers exported from the United States have\\n\\nshown no net increase. Prices of semi-manufacturers have\\n\\nincreased by only 8 percent. These classes form the bulk of\\n\\nour exports to Latin America. Among the other export\\n\\nproduct groups only the prices of manufactured foodstuffs\\n\\nhave increased as much as 20 percent. Against this the ceil- ing prices for Santos No. 4,and for Manizales are in the\\n\\nneighborhood of 80 percent above their levels in the first\\n\\nhalf of 1940. Further, the change in Brazil’s balance of\\n\\ntrade from an unfavorable to a substantially favorable one\\n\\nhas been attributed by Brazil to the increase in the price\\n\\nof coffee.\\n\\n8. The Board has suggested that the ceiling prices be\\n\\n', '\\n\\nbased on an average of prices over a period of time rather\\n\\nthan on the prices as of a single day. The objective of the\\n\\noriginal schedule was to prevent the development of run- away prices in the coffee market. For this purpose, a date\\n\\npreceding the development of the speculative advance is\\n\\nfully as adequate as the use of any average price. Revisions\\n\\nof the prices prevailing as of the freezing date, when basic\\n\\nconditions warrant, have always been part of Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration policy. As to differentials, the amended\\n\\norder contains the unanimous recommendations of the trade,\\n\\nwhich reflect experience over an extended period of time.\\n\\n9. Finally, the Board mentioned that the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration consider allowing a 25-point tolerance above\\n\\nthe ceiling level. It is assumed that this recommendation\\n\\nwas aimed at securing more flexibility in the ceiling. This\\n\\nhas been attained by the amended order, which permits trad- ing above the ceiling in the event of increases in freight and\\n\\ninsurance.\\n\\n10. Several courses of action are being followed by the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration in order to maintain the\\n\\norderly marketing of coffee and to insure the maintenance\\n\\nof trading and import in satisfactory volume. All of these\\n\\nare at present embodied in the draft of the amendment to\\n\\nPrice Schedule No. 50, which is attached, and of these, two\\n\\nare particularly important. The first is the provision ef- fecting flexibility in the price ceilings to cover increases in\\n\\nfreight and insurance rates. This is discussed in paragraph\\n\\n5 above.\\n\\n11. The second important amendment is in subsection\\n\\n1351.1 (c) which extends the list of types and grades of\\n\\ncoffee for which specific ceilings are stated and which estab-\\n\\n', '\\n\\nlishes differentials between these types somewhat different\\n\\nfrom those established by the original price schedule. The\\n\\nprice differentials upon which the amended price schedule\\n\\nis based were submitted to the Office of Price Administration\\n\\nby representatives of all branches of the green coffee trade\\n\\nat a meeting in New York on December 18. These repre- sentatives agreed unanimously upon the fairness of the dif- ferentials they submitted and pointed out that the differen- tials which had prevailed over a long period of time had\\n\\nbeen considered. In the face of such unanimity and in view\\n\\nof the fact that such differentials are in accord with the\\n\\nanalysis made by members of the staff of the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration, it is believed that they should be embodied\\n\\nin the amended schedule.\\n\\n12. It is important to the coffee-producing countries and\\n\\nto the United States that the free movement of coffee be\\n\\nmaintained at this time, particularly in view of the possi- bility that shipping shortages may limit shipments later in\\n\\nthe season. In these circumstances the Inter-American Cof- fee Board can contribute to the attainment of this objective\\n\\nby continuing to bring to the attention of the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration considerations affecting operation of the ceil- ing price schedule; and by continuing its adherence to the\\n\\nprinciples expressed in previous resolutions and declarations,\\n\\nparticularly those of October 23, 1941. The Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration further suggests that the orderly marketing\\n\\nand the continuation of a satisfactory volume of coffee trad- ing would be significantly assisted at this time by the issu- ance of a statement by the Board expressing the view that\\n\\nthe revised price order offers a sound basis for trading in\\n\\ncoffee under present conditions.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING THE\\n\\nREVISED ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF PRICE ADMIN- ISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES DATED\\n\\nDECEMBER 27, 1941, ESTABLISHING NEW\\n\\nPRICE SCHEDULE FOR GREEN COFFEE\\n\\nIn pursuance of the resolution approved by the Inter- American Coffee Board at its meeting of December 18,\\n\\n1941, the Board has been in touch with the officials of the\\n\\nUnited States Government concerned with emergency\\n\\nmeasures of price control. This contact has afforded an\\n\\nopportunity for certain considerations of importance to the\\n\\nBoard to be brought before these officials, as a contribution\\n\\nto the study which has been made of this important problem.\\n\\nIn the revised order of the Office of Price Administration\\n\\nof the United States, dated December 27, 1941, amending\\n\\nand amplifying the preliminary order of December 11, the\\n\\nBoard has noted with gratification that its recommendations,\\n\\nand specifically its resolution of December 18, have been\\n\\ntaken into account, and that in the new price schedule which\\n\\nhas been established coffee producers will be protected\\n\\nagainst fluctuations in ocean freight rates and charges for\\n\\nmaritime insurance and war risk insurance over which they\\n\\nhave no control.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board believes that the re- vised price schedule of December 27, 1941, establishes a\\n\\nsound basis for trading in coffee under present conditions.\\n\\nIt is accordingly hoped that there will be a continuation\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 24\\n\\nMeeting No. 21\\n\\nDecember 26, 1941\\n\\n', '\\n\\nof a satisfactory volume of coffee trading, in accordance with\\n\\nprevious resolutions and declarations of the Board, partic- ularly those of October 23, 1941.

In order to obviate any obstacle which\\n\\nmight interrupt the flow of coffee to the United States in\\n\\nthese times, the Board declares that it intends to remove\\n\\nthe limit of 15%, if it should become an obstacle. In this\\n\\nmanner it will be possible to take advantage, to the fullest\\n\\nextent possible, of all available shipping space for the trans- portation of coffee to this market during the current quota\\n\\nyear, in accordance with the other provisions of the afore- said resolution.\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 26\\n\\nMeeting No. 24\\n\\nMarch 5, 1942\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 27\\n\\nMeeting No. 25\\n\\nApril 7, 1942\\n\\nLETTER ADDRESSED TO WAR SHIPPING ADMIN- ISTRATION REGARDING SUSPENSION OF\\n\\nCONFERENCE RESTRICTIONS ON THE\\n\\nSHIPMENT OF COFFEE DURING THE\\n\\nEMERGENCY\\n\\nMarch 12, 1942\\n\\nMy dear Admiral Land:\\n\\nI enclose for your information a copy and translation of\\n\\na letter dated March 7, 1942, which I have received from\\n\\nthe Department of Coffee Exports of the Republic of El\\n\\nSalvador, describing the difficulties recently experienced\\n\\nthere in shipping coffee to the United States because of the\\n\\ncontinuation of the restrictions and limitations imposed by\\n\\nthe Camexco Freight Conference. For your further\\n\\ninformation I am likewise enclosing a copy of my reply of\\n\\ntoday’s date.\\n\\nI believe you will agree that current conditions in the\\n\\nfield of maritime transportation are completely different\\n\\nfrom those existing in normal times which justify the estab- lishment of shipping conferences and the limitations and\\n\\nrestrictions pertaining thereto. At the same time, it is\\n\\napparent that during these days it is a matter of paramount\\n\\nimportance, not only to the United States but to the coffee- producing countries, to take advantage of every available\\n\\ninch of shipping space for the movement of cargo to this\\n\\ncountry.\\n\\nAccordingly, I should welcome an expression of your\\n\\nviews as to whether it would not be in the national interest\\n\\nfor the existing conference restrictions on the shipment of\\n\\ncoffee to the United States to be suspended for the duration\\n\\nof the current shipping emergency. Such action would in\\n\\nnowise involve any discussion of the conference principle in\\n\\ngeneral and its basic justification, but rather would be merely\\n\\nan emergency measure to facilitate the movement of coffee\\n\\nto the United States at a time when all shipping should be\\n\\nused to the fullest extent possible.\\n\\nSince this matter is of interest and importance to all\\n\\nthe coffee-producing countries, it would be preferable if\\n\\nyour reply to this inquiry could cover not only the Camexco\\n\\nFreight Conference, but likewise any other shipping\\n\\nconference engaged in the movement of coffee from the\\n\\nother American republics to the United States.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\n(Sgd.) Paul C. Daniels,\\n\\nChairman\\n\\n(TRANSLATION)\\n\\nDEPARTAMENTO DE EXPORTACIONES DE CAFE\\n\\nOficina de Control\\n\\nSan Salvador, El Salvador, C. A.\\n\\nMarch 7, 1942.\\n\\nMy dear Mr. Daniels:\\n\\nOn February 16th a vessel flying the British flag arrived\\n\\nat the port of Cutuco (La Union) to make repairs on its\\n\\nengines. From the communication we had with the master\\n\\nof this ship, we learned that it was nearly empty and that\\n\\n', '\\n\\nits destination was San Francisco, Calif. We inquired whether\\n\\nshe could take on freight and he informed that he could\\n\\ntake some 35,000 bags of coffee for that destination if\\n\\nanyone wished to export them.\\n\\nForeseeing the possibility that it might be under special\\n\\norders, our Government early the 17th contacted our Min- ister in Washington asking him to inquire and inform whe- ther the Maritime Commission and the British Naval Author- ities would consent to the utilization of the empty space on\\n\\nthe above-mentioned ship.\\n\\nThe following message was received from our Minister\\n\\nearly the 18th:\\n\\nSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY—SAN SALVADOR BRITISH MARI- TIME AUTHORITIES AND U. S. MARITIME COMMISSION MAKE NO\\n\\nOBJECTION NOR REQUIRE CLEARANCE FOR CONTEMPLATED\\n\\nCOFFEE SHIPMENT ON BOARD SHIP OF J. C. WEBSTER AND SON,\\n\\nSO ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE MADE THERE IF SPACE IS AVAILABLe!\\n\\nCASTRO\\n\\nWe immediately contacted our Consul in San Fran- cisco, Calif., senor Ramirez, instructing him to request au- thorization from the CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFER- ENCE in order that the ship in question, which does not\\n\\nbelong to any company affiliated with the Conference, might\\n\\nload coffee without this being construed as a violation by\\n\\nthe exporters of their exclusive freight contracts with the\\n\\nabove-named Conference.\\n\\nOn the 19th we received the following message from\\n\\nour Consul:\\n\\nAGUSTIN ALFARO—SAN SALVADOR—I HAD DIFFICULTY IN TELE- PHONING TO INFORM THAT THE MATTER CONCERNING THE\\n\\nSHIPMENT HAS BEEN SETTLED. PERMISSION WAS OBTAINED FROM\\n\\nMARITIME CONFERENCE AUTHORIZING THE LOADING OF SAL-\\n\\n', '\\n\\nVADOREAN SHIPMENT WHICH MUST BE MADE FROM LA UNION\\n\\nAND LA LIBERTAD RESPECTIVELY. IMPORTERS ARE EXEMPT\\n\\nFROM PENALTIES. GRACE COOPERATED EFFECTIVELY.\\n\\nCONSALVA\\n\\nAs these steps were being taken, and since we could not\\n\\noffer any assurance as to their success, the vessel finished its\\n\\nrepairs and sailed from Cutuco on the night of the 18th.\\n\\nIn view of this we requested that the corresponding author- ities sent a radiogram to the ship instructing it to return to\\n\\nLa Union, which message was sent according to information\\n\\nreceived from our Consul in San Francisco. Since, as we\\n\\nunderstand, all ships have orders not to act on messages re- ceived on the high seas, we awaited the return of the ship\\n\\nfor several days with the coffee on dock ready to load imme- diately. For one reason or another the ship did not return,\\n\\nand the entire shipment is still at the port awaiting the\\n\\narrival of some ship sailing North. We wish to bring to\\n\\nyour attention the fact that the last ship sailing in that\\n\\ndirection which called at Cutuco came on February 4th last,\\n\\nand that to this date we know of no other liner which is to\\n\\ncall at this port in the future.\\n\\nSince then we have received correspondence from our\\n\\nConsul in San Francisco, giving a detailed account of the\\n\\nsteps taken in that city, and find in our correspondence the\\n\\nfollowing letter from the Camexco:\\n\\n\\'•CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE—SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,\\n\\nFEBRUARY 19, 1942—HONORABLE JORGE RAMIREZ, CONSUL GEN- ERAL OF EL SALVADOR, RUSS BUILDING, SAN FRANCISCO, CALI- FORNIA.\\n\\nDEAR MR. RAMIREZ: THIS WILL CONFIRM OUR TELEPHONE\\n\\nCONVERSATION OF TODAY WHEREIN WE ADVISED YOU THAT\\n\\nCAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SIGNA- TORIES TO ITS FREIGHTING AGREEMENTS USING FACILITIES OF\\n\\nTHE SS \"MAGISTER”, A NON-CONFERENCE VESSEL NOW AT LA\\n\\nUNION, EL SALVADOR, FOR THIS ONE VOYAGE, FOR THE TRANS-\\n\\n', '\\n\\nPORTATION OF GREEN COFFEE FROM THE PORTS OF LA UNION\\n\\nAND LA LIBERTAD, EL SALVADOR, TO NORTH PACIFIC COAST\\n\\nPORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. WE TRUST THE\\n\\nACTION ON THE PART OF THIS CONFERENCE WILL BE OF SERVICE\\n\\nTO YOU. YOURS VERY TRULY, (S) C R. KING, CHAIRMAN- SECRETARY.\\n\\nAs may be gathered from the letter quoted above, the\\n\\nauthorization for using ships belonging to companies which\\n\\nare not affiliates of the Conference was granted only for the\\n\\nparticular case for which it was requested. We are, there- fore, still unable to utilize any space which might become\\n\\navailable if a ship not affiliated to the Conference should call,\\n\\nsince the request for permission takes time and it would not\\n\\nbe unlikely that, by the time the authorization is obtained, the\\n\\nship should have left our shores as in the case of the **MAG- ISTER”.\\n\\nOn this very date the selfsame situation has come up\\n\\nagain. We are acting in San Francisco to obtain authoriza- tion from the CAMEXCO to utilize the facilities offered by\\n\\nan oil tanker to carry North from 15,000 to 18,000 bags.\\n\\nOf course, in this case, besides the authorization of the Con- ference we must obtain that of the importers who, although\\n\\nthe holds of the ship are perfectly clean, might fear lest the\\n\\ncoffee should suffer by being stored near petroleum. Never- theless, it would be easier to operate if we had to consult\\n\\nthem only without having to wait until after the Confer- ence has given its decision.\\n\\nWe have taken the liberty of bringing to your attention\\n\\nthis lengthy exposition in order to acquaint you perfectly\\n\\nwith the circumstances, to see if there is anything which\\n\\nmight be done to alleviate the difficulties besetting maritime\\n\\ntransportation.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nWe believe that the Conference should be less exacting\\n\\nin these times of emergency, inasmuch as it is not able to\\n\\nserve the ports of these countries regularly with ships of its\\n\\naffiliated companies. Moreover, aside from the transporta- tion of coffee, it is a pity to see ships with available space,\\n\\nwasting time, fuel and money—precious in these moments—\\n\\nwhile shipments are left along their route, which might\\n\\neasily be transported were it not for hindrances and obli- gations which, however justifiable they may be in normal\\n\\ntimes of close competition, are obstacles in crises so acute as\\n\\nthe present one.\\n\\nIn other words, we would desire that efforts be made\\n\\nto obtain full authorization from the Maritime Conferences\\n\\nto employ all facilities which may be available for the trans- portation of freight which lies in wait for ships in our ports.\\n\\nIn various instances recommendations have been made to\\n\\nthe producing countries to take advantage of all shipping\\n\\nfacilities to ship to the United States as much coffee as pos- sible in the briefest time possible. We are trying to coop- erate in every way towards that end, and, for that reason,\\n\\nare anxious to eliminate the difficulties which exist by reason\\n\\nof technicalities.\\n\\nWith expressions of our highest consideration and per- sonal esteem, we are.\\n\\nYours very truly,\\n\\n(Sgd.)

This period may be extended by the Board.\\n\\nIf said recommendations are accepted by all the par- ticipating Governments, the participating Governments\\n\\nundertake to take such measures as may be necessary to\\n\\ncarry out said recommendations. The Board shall draw\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 29\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\n', '\\n\\nup a declaration certifying the terms of said recommenda- tions and their acceptance by all the participating Gov- ernments, and the present Agreement shall be deemed to\\n\\nbe amended in accordance with this declaration as from\\n\\nthe date specified therein. A certified copy of the decla- ration together with a certified copy of the Agreement as\\n\\namended shall be communicated to the Pan American\\n\\nUnion and to each of the participating Governments.\\n\\nThe same procedure for making amendments or for\\n\\nthe continuation of the Agreement may be followed at\\n\\nany other time.”\\n\\nThe foregoing Article, and the procedure which it con- templates, make it necessary to give attention to two major\\n\\nproblems in connection with the possible renewal of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement: (1) possible changes in\\n\\nthe substance of the Agreement; and (2) the legal prob- lems presented in effecting any changes in the Agreement\\n\\nor in continuing the Agreement without change.\\n\\nWith respect to the first point, namely, possible changes\\n\\nin the substance of the provisions of the Agreement, it is\\n\\nsuggested that each Delegate present to the Board not later\\n\\nthan at the ordinary session of the Board on July 7, his\\n\\nrecommendations regarding possible changes in the substance\\n\\nand text of the Agreement.\\n\\nWith reference to the second point, the views of each\\n\\nparticipating Government should be ascertained and made\\n\\nknown to all of the Delegates as soon as possible. In this\\n\\nconnection consideration should be given, I believe, to the\\n\\nfollowing points:\\n\\n', '\\n\\n1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board recommends\\n\\nto each participating Government that the Agreement be\\n\\ncontinued for a specified or unspecified period beyond\\n\\nOctober 1, 1943, without any change whatsoever, will it\\n\\nbe necessary for each Government to re-submit the Agree- ment to the National Congress with a view to obtaining\\n\\nCongressional approval?\\n\\n2. If the Board recommends continuation of the\\n\\nAgreement with only very slight changes of a purely\\n\\nphraseological character, not involving any substantive\\n\\nchange in the Agreement, would submission to the Con- gress be necessary?\\n\\n3. If the Board should recommend the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement with important changes of substance,\\n\\nwould Congressional approval be necessary?\\n\\nNo doubt other questions of a legal or technical char- acter will arise in connection with the possible renewal of\\n\\nthe Coffee Agreement, but it would be most convenient if\\n\\nthe foregoing questions could be answered at once. Each\\n\\nof the participating Governments has a direct and immediate\\n\\ninterest in the legal and procedural problems which may be\\n\\nconfronted in all of the other countries, because we all have\\n\\na common interest in the Agreement. If difficulties should\\n\\nbe encountered of a legal or procedural character, causing\\n\\na lapse in the legal force of the Agreement, a most unfor- tunate situation might arise. Accordingly, I urge that this\\n\\nimportant problem be studied urgently by each Delegate in\\n\\norder that the views of all the participating Governments\\n\\nmay be made known to all of us at the earliest possible date.\\n\\n(Sgd.) Paul C. Daniels,\\n\\nChairman\\n\\n', '\\n\\nRESOLUTION REMOVING THE LIMIT OF 15% ON\\n\\nADVANCE SHIPMENTS\\n\\nWHEREAS\\n\\n1. The Inter-American Coffee Board has repeatedly ex- pressed its policy to the effect that full advantage be taken\\n\\nof all shipping space available for the movement of coffee\\n\\nto the United States;\\n\\n2. In a resolution approved by the Inter-American Cof- fee Board on October 23, 1941, authorization was granted\\n\\nby the Board to the producing countries to ship coffee to\\n\\nthe United States in excess of the quotas for the current\\n\\nquota year, under certain conditions, up to a limit of 15%\\n\\nof their respective basic quotas;\\n\\n3. On March 5, 1942, the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nannounced its intention of removing the aforesaid limit of\\n\\n15% if it should become an obstacle to the movement of\\n\\ncoffee to the United States;\\n\\n4. The circumstances outlined in the foregoing para- graph are about to arise;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To remove the limit of 15% on shipments of coffee\\n\\nin excess of existing quotas provided for in the resolution of\\n\\nOctober 23, 1941, maintaining the other provisions of that\\n\\nresolution.\\n\\n2. To communicate this resolution to the Governments\\n\\nof the countries participating in the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement.\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 30\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\n', '\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 31\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\nRESOLUTION REQUESTING PARTICIPATING GOV- ERNMENTS TO STUDY CERTAIN QUESTIONS\\n\\nIN CONNECTION WITH POSSIBLE CON- TINUATION OF THE INTER-AMERI- CAN COFFEE AGREEMENT\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\nThe date is approaching on which the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board must apply the provisions contained in Article\\n\\nXXIV of the Coffee Agreement;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\nTo address itself to the Governments through its dele- gates requesting the Governments to transmit in writing\\n\\ntheir points of view regarding the application of the mech- anism established in Article XXIV in relation to the consti- tutional requirements of their respective countries, replying\\n\\nspecifically to the following questions:\\n\\n1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board should rec- onunend to each one of the participating Governments\\n\\nthat the Agreement be continued for a definite or indefi- nite time after October 1, 1943, without changes of any\\n\\nkind, will it be necessary for each Government again to\\n\\nsubmit the Agreement to the National Congress for ap- proval?\\n\\n', '\\n\\n2. If the Board should recommend that the Agree- ment be continued with slight modifications of phrase- ology but not of substance, would it be necessary to submit\\n\\nit to Congress?\\n\\n3. If the Board should recommend the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement with important changes of substance,\\n\\nwould it be necessary to obtain the approval of the Con- gress?\\n\\n', '\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING EMER- GENCY INCREASE OF THE COFFEE QUOTAS\\n\\nFOR THE UNITED STATES MARKET\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board at its regular meet- ing held today approved an emergency increase of the coffee\\n\\nquotas for the United States market, with the understanding\\n\\nthat this increase is to apply solely to the current quota year\\n\\nand that at the commencement of the next quota year the\\n\\nquotas will be adjusted so as to correspond with the esti- mated requirements of the United States market. As a\\n\\nresult coffees which have arrived from a few countries in\\n\\nexcess of the existing quotas may be released from customs\\n\\nsupervision and entered for immediate consumption.\\n\\nThe immediate effect of this resolution will be to relieve\\n\\ncertain coffee importers of small storage charges on these\\n\\ncoffees which otherwise would be held in warehouse under\\n\\ncustoms supervision until next October 1. While these\\n\\ncharges are a relatively minor item in the cost of coffee,\\n\\nthe Board feels that everything possible should be done to\\n\\nremove any unnecessary or avoidable charges on the coffee\\n\\ntrade during these difficult times.\\n\\nAt no time, now or hitherto, have the quotas estab- lished by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement had the\\n\\neffect of preventing the shipment of coffee from producing\\n\\ncountries to the United States. On the contrary, they\\n\\nhave had the effect of greatly stimulating such shipments,\\n\\nwhich in 1941 reached the highest level in history. Advance\\n\\nshipments on next year’s quota to an unlimited amount\\n\\nwere authorized by the Board in its resolution of April 29,\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 32\\n\\nMeeting No. 30\\n\\nJuly 15, 1942\\n\\n', '\\n\\n1942. Accordingly, no increase in the amount of coffee\\n\\nshipped to the United States will result from the current\\n\\nincrease of the quotas, but such coffee as does arrive will\\n\\nbe more readily available for special uses and with somewhat\\n\\nless cost to the importers.\\n\\nIt is impossible for the Board to predict at this time\\n\\nwhether or not a similar increase of the quotas will be nec- essary or desirable before the end of the next quota year.\\n\\nThe decision will be made at that time on the basis of facts\\n\\nand conditions as they then exist, particularly in regard to\\n\\nthe shipping situation. It is the Board’s avowed intention\\n\\nto maintain the basis for the orderly marketing of coffee\\n\\nestablished by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, and\\n\\nthe action taken today is to be construed as evidence of the\\n\\nBoard’s desire to adapt itself to emergency conditions rather\\n\\nthan as any change in its basic policy.\\n\\nThe newly established quotas for the current quota year\\n\\nending next September 30 are as follows;\\n\\nCountry Quota\\n\\nBrazil 13,772,990\\n\\nColombia 4,668,142\\n\\nCosta Rica 296,242\\n\\nCuba 118,888\\n\\nDominican Republic 177,835\\n\\nEcuador 222,377\\n\\nEl Salvador 935,779\\n\\nGuatemala 793,042\\n\\nHaiti 407,241\\n\\nHonduras 31,689\\n\\nMexico 729,072\\n\\nNicaragua 309,152\\n\\nPeru 37,022\\n\\nVenezuela 431,527\\n\\n', '\\n\\nRESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN EMERGENCY\\n\\nINCREASE OF THE QUOTAS FOR THE\\n\\nUNITED STATES MARKET\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1. The current lack of shipping facilities to transport\\n\\ncoffee from the producing countries to the United States\\n\\nin volume sufficient to satisfiy the requirements of the United\\n\\nStates market has created a shortage of coffee in the United\\n\\nStates market.\\n\\n2. By virtue of a resolution approved April 29, 1942,\\n\\nthe Inter-American Coffee Board provided for advance\\n\\nshipments of coffee in excess of existing quotas, such excess\\n\\nshipments to be charged against next year’s quota but to be\\n\\nstored under customs supervision until the beginning of\\n\\nthe next quota year.\\n\\n3. The measures referred to in paragraph 2 above have\\n\\nmade possible the continuous and uninterrupted flow of cof- fee to the United State in so far as the provisions of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement are concerned, but the\\n\\nexisting prohibition against the entry of these excess coffees\\n\\nfor immediate consumption causes small additional storage\\n\\ncharges for the account of the trade and may prevent the\\n\\nprompt and uninterrupted movement of these coffees into\\n\\nthe channels of distribution.\\n\\n4. It is desirable during this period of emergency to\\n\\nadminister the provisions of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement with all possible flexibility, in order to eliminate\\n\\nAPPENDIX NO. 33\\n\\nMeeting No. 30\\n\\nJuly 15,1942\\n\\n', '\\n\\nany unnecessary inconvenience or expense to the coffee trade\\n\\nor the consuming public at large.\\n\\n5. It is essential, however, to maintain the procedure\\n\\nfor orderly marketing established by the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement, particularly in Articles I and III thereof,\\n\\nand accordingly the emergency quota readjustment ap- proved by this resolution is solely for the current quota\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nTHEREFORE RESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To increase the quotas for the United States market\\n\\nas of July 16, 1942, to 277% of the basic quotas, in accord- ance with Article VIII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, so that the quotas for the current year will be as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\nCountry Quota*\\n\\nBrazil 13,772,990\\n\\nColombia 4,668,142\\n\\nCosta Rica 296,242\\n\\nCuba 118,888\\n\\nDominican Republic 177,835\\n\\nEcuador 222,377\\n\\nEl Salvador 935,779\\n\\nGuatemala 793,042\\n\\nHaiti 407,241\\n\\nHonduras 31,689\\n\\nMexico 729,072\\n\\nNicaragua 309,152\\n\\nPeru 37,022\\n\\nVenezuela 431,527\\n\\n• Adjustments have been made for over-and undershipments during the quota year\\n\\n1940-1941.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n2.

The Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard recommends to each Government that great care be\\n\\nexercised in issuing such certificates, in order to guarantee\\n\\nthe effective administration of the quotas and smooth oper- ation of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article VI of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement there have been a few\\n\\ninstances where the export certificates referred to above\\n\\nhave been issued to an amount in excess of the correspond- ing quota as fixed by the Inter-American Coffee Board In\\n\\nsuch cases losses and inconveniences have been incurred by\\n\\ncoffee traders. The Inter-American Coffee Board sincerely\\n\\nregrets any losses or inconveniences which have been or may\\n\\nbe incurred by either exporters or importers as the result\\n\\nof the improper issuance of export certificates. The Board\\n\\nrecommends that in any such cases the interested parties\\n\\ncommunicate directly with the proper officials in the ex- porting country with a view to seeking relief, and is confi- dent that through direct arrangements of this character\\n\\nequitable and mutually satisfactory solutions may be reached.\\n\\nRESOLUTION RECOMMENDING CONTINUATION\\n\\nOF INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE AGREEMENT\\n\\nWITHOUT CHANGE FOR AN ADDI- TIONAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1.

The Inter-American Coffee Agreement has pro- duced results which have been beneficial for the interests\\n\\nof the participating countries, and present circumstances\\n\\nrender advisable, for the common benefit, the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement in order to avoid the disorderly condi- tions which without the functioning of the Agreement would\\n\\ninevitably arise in the coffee market;\\n\\n3. To re-open at this time the discussion between the\\n\\nsignatory countries to introduce changes in the text of the\\n\\nAgreement would seriously compromise—in the judgment\\n\\nof the Board—the renewal of the Agreement;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1.

No such increase or decrease shall be made oftener than once every six months nor shall any change at any one time exceed 5 percent of the basic quotas specified in Article I. The total increase or decrease in the first quota year shall not exceed 5 percent of such basic quotas. Any increase or\\n\\ndecrease in the quotas shall remain in effect until superseded by a new change in quotas, and the quotas for any quota year shall be calculated by applying to the basic quotas the weighted average of the changes made by the Board during the same year. Except as provided in Articles IV, V and VII, the percentage of each of the participating countries in the total quantity of coffee which these countries may export to the United States market shall be maintained unchanged.\\n\\nThe Board shall also have the authority to increase or decrease the export quotas for the market outside the United States to the extent that it deems necessary to adjust supplies to estimated requirements, maintaining unchanged the per\\xad centage of each of the participating countries in the total quantity of coffee to be exported to that market, except as\\n\\n', '\\n\\n \\nArticle V\\n\\nIn view of the possibility of changes in the demand for coffee of a particular origin in the market outside the United States, the Board is empowered, by a two-thirds vote, to transfer, on the request of any participating country, a part of that country*s quota for the United States market to its quota for the market outside the United States in order to bring about a better balance between supply and demand in special types of coffee.

These conditions aggravated an already\\n\\nserious surplus problem in coffee-producing countries and\\n\\nbrought about a decline in coffee prices to extremely low\\n\\nlevels. The Board does not believe that the continuation of\\n\\ndistress prices which threaten the economic stability and\\n\\npurchasing power of producers is in the interest of coffee con- sumers or is desired by them.\\n\\nThe Board wishes to make clear, however, that it will be\\n\\nits purpose, in the administration of the Agreement, to main- tain coffee prices at reasonable levels which will encourage\\n\\nconsumption. For the United States, which constitutes the\\n\\nlargest single market for coffee, there has been a significant\\n\\nincrease in consumption in recent years. The Board believes\\n\\nthat, with the maintenance of reasonable prices, consumption\\n\\nin the United States may be further increased and that the\\n\\nsurplus problem in producing countries may be thereby\\n\\nsubstantially alleviated. Consumers in the United States may\\n\\naccordingly be assured that their interests will be safeguarded\\n\\nunder this program of inter-American cooperation.\\n\\n[58]\\n\\nMEMORANDUM REGARDING CONVERSION\\n\\nFACTORS\\n\\nThe oflScial statistics of the United States Department of\\n\\nCommerce relative to coffee imports are in pounds. The\\n\\nGovernment of the United States will convert bags of 60\\n\\nkilograms, the unit of measure specified in the Agreement, to\\n\\npounds for quota purposes at the rate of one bag equals\\n\\n132.276 pounds.\\n\\nUnder the Agreement imports of roasted coffee are in- cluded within the import quotas established by the United\\n\\nStates. Therefore it is necessary that a basis be established\\n\\nfor charging such imports to the quotas. The Government\\n\\nof the United States proposes, if the Board concurs, to use\\n\\nthe factor of 1.2 in converting imports of roasted coffee to\\n\\nthe green coffee equivalent for quota purposes. Thus quan- tities of imports of roasted coffee will be multiplied by the\\n\\nfactor 1.2. This assumes an average shrinkage in the roasting\\n\\nprocess of approximately 16 percent.\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX No. 2', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 1\\n\\nApril 17, 1941\\n\\n[59]\\n\\nRESOLUTION REQUESTING STATISTICS ON SALES\\n\\nREGISTRATIONS IN PRODUCING COUNTRIES\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1.

Y.,\\n\\nJuly 9, 1941.\\n\\nPaul C. Daniels, Chairman,\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Board,\\n\\n2400 16 Street, Northwest,\\n\\nWashington, D. C.\\n\\nOn behalf of the United States coffee trade I respect- fully call to your attention the following facts namely that\\n\\nfive of the governments, parties to the Inter-American Cof- fee Treaty, have failed in their obligations under the treaty\\n\\nin the following respects. Venezuela in that it permitted\\n\\nan agency wholly financed by the government to consign\\n\\nlarge quantities of coffee in the United States and that it\\n\\npermitted coffee to be exported greatly in excess of its quota\\n\\nin direct violation of Articles Four and Seventeen of the\\n\\nagreement. Guatemala in that it permitted coffee to be ex- ported in amoxmts so greatly in excess of its quota as to indi- cate a lack of serious effort to control exports as it is required\\n\\nto do under Article Four of the Agreement. Haiti in that it\\n\\ninstituted regulations which make it impossible for American\\n\\nimporters to secure coffee they have already purchased with- out paying an additional sum to Haitian exporters. This is\\n\\nviolation of Article Seventeen of the agreement. Brazil as\\n\\nis clearly indicated has permitted amounts of coffee to be\\n\\nregistered greatly in excess of its quota and has on some oc- ', 'APPENDIX No. 12', \"\\n\\nMeeting No. 8\\n\\nJuly 9, 1941\\n\\n[73]\\n\\ncasions refused export permits of coflFee properly registered\\n\\nand has permitted its quota to be filled without regard for\\n\\ncoffees sold registered and intended for shipment in August\\n\\nand September all this in violation of Articles Six and Seven- teen of the treaty. Colombia in that it permitted coffee to\\n\\nbe shipped in excess of its quota in violation of Article Four\\n\\nof the treaty in that it failed to take measures required in\\n\\nArticle Six of the treaty. In that it did, we have reason to\\n\\nbelieve, permit a government dependency to consign coffee\\n\\nto the United States in violation of Article Seventeen and\\n\\nfinally in that it made possible a severe shortage of Colom- bian coffees on the west coast of the United States. All these\\n\\nacts of commission and omission havec caused serious disrup- tion to the trade in the United States and have caused indivi- dual importers serious and unjustified losses. In view of the\\n\\nobvious equities in the matter we believe ourselves entitled\\n\\nto request expression from the Board as to whether the Board\\n\\nhas or can secure authority to arbitrate the losses sustained\\n\\nand proved by United States importers on account of the\\n\\nfailure mentioned above and if it can secure from the gov- ernment in question authority to make adequate compensa- tion for these losses. We would like to be informed also as\\n\\nto what guarantee the Board can secure for itself and for the\\n\\ntrade of the United States that the above mentioned failures\\n\\nof compliance will not re-occur. The coffee trade has and\\n\\ndoes support the quota system as written into the treaty be- lieving it a necessary and desirable action but feels that the\\n\\nsystem cannot function under circumstances which make\\n\\ncontracts meaningless or unless the Board assumes the full\\n\\nauthority of administration assigned it under the provisions\\n\\nof the treaty. Respectfully,\\n\\nGeorge C. THreRBACH,\\n\\n'President\\n\\nNATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIATION\\n\\n[74]\\n\\n\", 'APPENDIX No. 13', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 9\\n\\nJuly 17,1941\\n\\nLETTERTO THE NATIONAL COFFEE ASSOCIATION\\n\\nREPLYING TO THE ASSOCIATION’S\\n\\nCOMPLAINTS\\n\\nJuly 18,1941.\\n\\nMr. George C. Thierbach, ^\\n\\nPresident, National Coffee Association,\\n\\n120 Wall Street,\\n\\nNew York, New York.\\n\\nMy dear Mr. Thierbach;\\n\\nI acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated July\\n\\n9, 1941 in which you call to the attention of the Inter- American Coffee Board, on behalf of the United States coffee\\n\\ntrade, certain alleged irregularities in the operation and ad- ministration of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Sup- plementing the Board’s preliminary acknowledgment of July\\n\\n9, a more detailed reply is now submitted regarding the\\n\\nvarious points raised in your telegram under reference.\\n\\nYou call attention to the fact that in the case of certain\\n\\ncountries exports of coffee have taken place in excess of the\\n\\ncorresponding quotas for those countries. It is unques- tionably true that in the cases you mention coffee exports\\n\\nhave in fact exceeded the quotas established for those coun- tries. It is equally true that in the case of one country en- tries of coffee into the United States for consumption dur- ing the current quota year exceeded the corresponding coffee\\n\\nquota for that country. The Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nnaturally regrets that these discrepancies have occured dur-\\n\\n[75]\\n\\ning the present quota year, but feels impelled to call atten- tion to the following facts. In the first place, the Inter- American Coffee Agreement was not signed until nearly two\\n\\nmonths of the initial quota period had elapsed. Following\\n\\nsignature, the Agreement had no legal effect until such time\\n\\nas the instruments of ratification of the 15 participating\\n\\ncountries had been deposited in the Pan American Union, or\\n\\nuntil such time as it had been brought into effect by means\\n\\nof a protocol for the purpose as provided in Article XX. It\\n\\nwas not until April 15, 1941, or after more than one-half\\n\\nof the current quota year had elapsed, that the Inter- American Coffee Agreement became legally effective. Up\\n\\nuntil that date there was a lack of complete assurance in\\n\\neach of the 15 coimtries that the Agreement would in fact\\n\\nbecome effective, and it was correspondingly difficult for\\n\\neach of the 15 countries to perfect its laws, regulations and\\n\\nadministrative procedure in such a way as to harmonize with\\n\\nthe new and unprecedented coffee program established under\\n\\nthe terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement. Not- withstanding this difficulty, efforts were made in each of the\\n\\ncountries to anticipate the situation and to prepare for ade- quate means for discharging their obligations under the treaty.\\n\\nWhile the initial steps taken did not prove to be adequate in\\n\\nall cases, the experience received during the last few months\\n\\nhas been valuable and the Board is confident that each\\n\\nparticipating country is giving serious attention to the mat- ter in an effort to perfect its regulations and avoid a recur- rence of the difficulties brought about by exports in excess\\n\\nof the established quotas. The Board has received no evidence\\n\\nof any intention on the part of any participating government\\n\\ndeliberately to violate the terms of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement; rather, there is no doubt that the government\\n\\nof each producing country intends to take all appropriate\\n\\n[76]\\n\\nmeasures with a view to preventing in the future exports\\n\\nof coffee in excess of the duly established quotas.\\n\\nA somewhat similar problem has arisen by virtue of the\\n\\nfact that in at least one case there is evidence to indicate that\\n\\nregistrations of sales of coffee for future delivery have been\\n\\npermitted in excess of the corresponding quota. The same\\n\\ngeneral considerations set forth above in the preceding\\n\\npa**agraph apply likewise to this matter. There is ample\\n\\nevidence to indicate that neither the country in question,\\n\\nnor any other country, intends to permit a recurrence of this\\n\\ndifficidty during the coming quota year or at any time in\\n\\nthe future. Furthermore, the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nis undertaking the compilation of registration figures from\\n\\neach of the producing countries, has approved a standard\\n\\nform for submitting this information on a weekly basis, and\\n\\nbelieves that its efforts in this direction, together with im- proved regulations in the exporting countries, will make a\\n\\nrepetition of the problem extremely unlikely.\\n\\nProtest is made in your telegram under reference against\\n\\nthe consignment of coffee in the United States by govern- mental agencies or dependencies. Although the Board has\\n\\nnot received very detailed information or evidence on this\\n\\npoint, it has agreed as a matter of policy that governmental\\n\\nconsignments of this character should be discouraged or\\n\\nprohibited by each of the participating governments in order\\n\\nto maintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual op- eration of the coffee trade. It should be pointed out, how- ever, that governmental consignments of this character may\\n\\nwell have occurred prior to the entry into force of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and accordingly constitute a\\n\\nproblem for the trade which might exist in the absence of a\\n\\nquota agreement.\\n\\n[77]\\n\\nThere are enclosed statements submitted by the dele- gates of Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala discussing their\\n\\nindividual problems in more detail.\\n\\nReference is made in your telegram to the effect that\\n\\nregulations have been instituted in one of the participating\\n\\ncountries *Vhich make it impossible for American importers\\n\\nto secure coffee they have already purchased without paying\\n\\nan additional sum to . . . exporters”. The Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board states categorically that it is definitely opposed\\n\\nto any regulations in any of the countries participating in the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement which might have the\\n\\neffect of nullifying contracts entered into in good faith. The\\n\\nBoard believes that the sanctity of contracts in commercial\\n\\ndealings must be upheld at all costs; that the contract system\\n\\nprovides a useful method for handling the coffee business,\\n\\nwith benefits for producers, distributors and consumers\\n\\nalike. Accordingly, the Board desires to be informed of any\\n\\ncase where a contract entered into in good faith is nullified\\n\\nretroactively by official act. In the case cited in your tele- gram under reference, it is understood that the regulations\\n\\nin question do not prevent compliance with previously\\n\\nexisting contracts.\\n\\nThe present situation on the West Coast of the United\\n\\nStates due to the inability of importers to obtain delivery\\n\\non certain coffees which have been previously purchased,\\n\\nentry of which is prohibited by the closing of the quotas,\\n\\nis currently being considered by the Board in an effort to\\n\\ndetermine what action, if any, should be taken by the Board.\\n\\nIt is naturally desired that all reasonable and appropriate\\n\\nsteps be taken to avoid undue hardship on the part of any\\n\\nsingle individual or firm in the coffee trade of the United\\n\\n[78]\\n\\nStates; at the same time, the Board cannot help but feel a\\n\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement on a stable basis, and its operation in an\\n\\nimpartial, non-discriminatory manner for the protection\\n\\nof the coffee trade as a whole.\\n\\nYou inquire *\\'as to whether the Board has or can secure\\n\\nauthority to arbitrate the losses sustained^ and proved by\\n\\nUnited States importers”. Without entering into a discus- sion of whether the Board has or has not authority to act as\\n\\narbitrator for losses sustained in such cases, it may be stated\\n\\nthat in the opinion of the Board it would be of doubtful\\n\\nvalue for it to undertake the arbitration of disputes arising\\n\\nfrom losses. In certain cases resort to arbitration by a quali- fied arbitrator or group of arbitrators may provide the most\\n\\nexpedient manner for settling current problems; but it is not\\n\\nbelieved that the Inter-American Coffee Board would provide\\n\\na suitable means for this procedure at the present time. The\\n\\nBoard hopes, however, that it will be found possible for the\\n\\nparties at interest to work out a mutually satisfactory and\\n\\nequitable settlement.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board has noted with pleas- ure your statement that the coffee trade has supported and\\n\\ndoes support the quota system as written into the treaty. It\\n\\nagrees that the system cannot function under circumstances\\n\\nwhich make contracts meaningless. It is confident, as set\\n\\nforth above, that the problems which you have specified are\\n\\nessentially problems of transition, due primarily to the in- auguration of a vast and unprecedented control system re- quiring complete cooperation by 15 countries and presenting\\n\\na new set of circumstances for the operation of the coffee\\n\\ntrade. There is every reason to believe that the period of\\n\\nreadjustment to new conditions has largely been passed, and\\n\\n[79]\\n\\nthat there will be no recurrence of any of the problems listed\\n\\nin your telegram of July 9.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board is attempting to dis- charge its obligations in a thorough and impartial manner.\\n\\nIt has already taken many constructive steps which have been\\n\\nduly made known to the trade and the public. Its work is\\n\\nonly beginning. It welcomes constructive suggestions from\\n\\nall sources. Accordingly, if the National Coffee Association,\\n\\nor any other organization or individual in the United States\\n\\nhaving an interest in the coffee situation, has any specific sug- gestions as to any acts of commission or omission by the Inter- American Coffee Board, I can assure you that they will be\\n\\ngiven very careful attention by the Board. A cooperative\\n\\nattitude and a mutual understanding of each other’s problems\\n\\nand difficulties will go far towards eliminating the rough\\n\\nspots.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nPaul C. Daniels, Chairman.\\n\\nEnclosures:\\n\\nThree memoranda.\\n\\nEnclosure No. 1\\n\\n(TRANSLATION)\\n\\nNATIONAL COFFEE DEPARTMENT OF BRAZIL\\n\\n120 Wall Street\\n\\nNew York, N.Y.\\n\\nThe charges filed by the National Coffee Association\\n\\nagainst the National Coffee Department of Brazil are with- out foundation due to the following reasons:\\n\\n180]\\n\\n1. The excess (of less than 5% of our quota) in the\\n\\nregistration of sales for the first year of the agreement\\n\\nwas caused by our inability to obtain proper informa- tion at this end, such as classification of arrivals by ships\\n\\nand dates of entry into territories under American\\n\\njurisdiction. Therefore, not knowing the details per- taining to coffee shipments fulfilling the Brazilian quota\\n\\nunder the agreement, we were unable to determine (as\\n\\nwe still are, notwithstanding our request to the Inter- American Coffee Board) exactly when to stop registra- tion of coffee for this year’s quota. Such data was in- dispensable for rigid control of the first year’s quota,\\n\\ndue to the fact that the agreement signed in November\\n\\nincluded coffee already shipped from Brazil in Septem- ber, over which naturally we could not have had con- trol as is required under the terms of the Agreement;\\n\\n2. It is very likely that such circumstances and similar\\n\\nconditions were foreseen when the Agreement was\\n\\nsigned, since Article IV admitted the possibility of an\\n\\nexcess shipment and provided for such an excess to be\\n\\ndeducted from the next year’s quota;\\n\\n3. Furthermore, until the Agreement had been effectively\\n\\nratified by all the signatory countries it would be under- standable that we could not undertake all the neces- sary precuationary measures against such an excess, since\\n\\nit would have been against the interests of Brazil, in the\\n\\nevent that the Agreement were not put into effect.\\n\\nHowever, disregarding such possibilities, we closed the\\n\\nregistration of sales for the first year under the quota\\n\\non March 21, 1941, as stated in the communication of\\n\\nthe National Coffee Department of Brazil, released on\\n\\n[81]\\n\\n/\\n\\nMarch 22,1941, which was quite some time prior to the\\n\\ninstallation of the Inter-American Coffee Board, and be- fore the United States Government was legally able to\\n\\ntake the necessary steps for the control of coffee ship- ments entering this country under the provisions of the\\n\\nAgreement;\\n\\n4. We should add that the “shipment certificate” which is\\n\\nreferred to in Article VI of the Agreement, and which\\n\\nis indispensable for the identification of coffee ship- ments from each country, is, up to the present date,\\n\\nbeing enforced by Brazil only, and has not yet been\\n\\nconsidered by the United States Customs;\\n\\n5. There are no grounds for the statement that we have\\n\\nrefused permits for shipments of coffee properly regis- tered, and these facts may easily be verified by anyone\\n\\nwho is famiiliar with the coffee and exchange regula- tions of Brazil;\\n\\n6. In truth, what we have not allowed is the advance ship- ments of coffee which were registered for August and\\n\\nSeptember. This, however, is a matter pertaining to our\\n\\ndomestic economy and has no bearing on the terms of\\n\\nthe Agreement. Therefore, contrary to the charges\\n\\nbrought against us, we feel that we have given ample\\n\\nproof of our desire to fulfill all the terms of the Agree- ment, ^ shown for instance by the fact that although\\n\\ndisposing of a quota of 9,765,000 bags we have allocated\\n\\nto the exporters only 9,300,000 bags, thus compensating\\n\\nfor the small excess in the first year.\\n\\n(Sgd.) E. Penteado.\\n\\n[82]\\n\\nEnclosure No. 2\\n\\n(TRANSLATION)\\n\\nMEMORANDUM PRESENTED BY THE DELEGATE\\n\\nOF COLOMBIA\\n\\nIn the telegram addressed by the President of the Na- tional Coffee Association to the Chairman of the Inter- American Coffee Board it is stated, among other allegations\\n\\nmade to the countries signatory to the Inter-American Cof- fee Agreement, that Colombia has failed in fulfilling the\\n\\nobhgations imposed on it by the said treaty in respect of the\\n\\nfollowing points:\\n\\n1. For having permitted the shipment of coffee in excess\\n\\nof her quota, which constitutes a violation of Article IV of\\n\\nthe Treaty. This afBrmation has been made by the National\\n\\nCoffee Association without possessing official proofs of any\\n\\nkind to support it, since the fact that arrivals of Colombian\\n\\ncoffee in the United States during the quota year have ex- ceeded the quota fixed for Colombia, does not imply that that\\n\\ncountry permitted the registration of exports in excess of\\n\\nher quota; on the contrary, the information possessed by the\\n\\nColombian Delegate indicates that the respective official en- tities there took the greatest care and that there was exer- cised a strict supervision of registrations, which were suspend- ed when the quota was filled. What appears to have occurred\\n\\nis that subsequent to last October 1, there entered the United\\n\\nStates shipments of Colombian coffee which had left Colom- bia prior to that date, as seems to be the case with reference\\n\\nto coffee from the region of Cucuta which was shipped from\\n\\nVenezuela and which, it is understood, is held by the owners\\n\\nto be aged in that country for some time past; furthermore,\\n\\nas the statistics clearly show, it is understood that a good\\n\\n[83]\\n\\npart of the shipments registered in Colombia and destined\\n\\nfor Canada were held in this country by local importers,\\n\\nmembers of the coffee trade of the United States. How can\\n\\nColombia be held responsible for these occurrences, which\\n\\nwere entirely beyond her control, and how, on the basis of\\n\\nimportations which had this origin, can the totally unfounded\\n\\nallegation be made that Columbia has violated Article IV? In\\n\\nfact. Article IV treats of \"unforeseen circumstances” and\\n\\ncontemplates the case that the export quota of a given coun- try for the United States may be exceeded during the quota\\n\\nyear, and it is necessary to consider as cases of this character\\n\\nthose which have just been noted.\\n\\n2. It is alleged that Colombia failed in its obligation to\\n\\ntake the measures required by Article VI of the Treaty. That\\n\\nallegation is really surprising, to say the least, since everybody\\n\\nknows that Colombia was the first country which hastened on\\n\\nNovember 22, even before signing the Treaty, to take internal\\n\\nmeasures of various kinds tending to establish an adequate\\n\\ncontrol of the sales and exportation of coffee, precisely with\\n\\nthe purpose of avoiding difficulties which might arise in the\\n\\noperation of the Pact. The certificate referred to in Article\\n\\nVI is only now being discussed by the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard and even in the event that Colombia had issued it, in no\\n\\nway would the difficulties have been avoided which the lack\\n\\nof the certificate would have caused the coffee trade of the\\n\\nUnited States, since the United States had no legislation per- mitting the Custom houses to refuse entry to coffees not\\n\\ncovered by the said certificate.\\n\\n3. It is alleged that the Association has reasons to believe\\n\\nthat Colombia permitted a dependency of the Government\\n\\nto consign coffee to the United States in violation of Article\\n\\nXVII. In this case the Association limits itself to gathering\\n\\n[84]\\n\\nrumors and therefore, since it barely has \"reasons to believe”\\n\\nthat the said Article has been violated, it would be desirable\\n\\nif concrete proofs would be presented in this respect setting\\n\\nforth in what form there has been violation of Article XVII,\\n\\nwhich estabhshes that the participating Governments agree\\n\\nto maintain in so far as possible the normal and usual opera- tion of the coffee trade.\\n\\n4. It is alleged that Colombia made possible an acute\\n\\nshortage of coffee on the West Coast of the United States.\\n\\nThis is another allegation made without any solid founda- tion by the National Coffee ALSSociation, since it cannot well\\n\\nbe pretended that Colombia watches over the distribution of\\n\\ncoffee so that there will not arise shortages in the different\\n\\nregions of the United States. This is beyond its control and\\n\\nis the exclusive function of the importing trade and it is not\\n\\npossible to hold the Governments responsible for shipping\\n\\ndifficulties, customs regulations, or other special circum- stances which may have prevented the trade in a given zone\\n\\nof the United States from supplying itself adequately with\\n\\ngiven types of coffee.\\n\\nColombia, then, in rejecting the charges made by the\\n\\nAssociation, manifests her firm desire to support all measures\\n\\nwhich may be necessary to strengthen the spirit and letter of\\n\\nthe Pact and to enforce strict compliance with its provisions.\\n\\n(Signed) Rafael Montoya Perez.\\n\\nJuly 16, 1941.\\n\\nEnclosure No. 3\\n\\nMEMORANDUM\\n\\nThe Delegate of Guatemala wishes to inform that he\\n\\nfinds wholly unwarranted the statements, with reference\\n\\nto Guatemala, made by Mr. George C.

Similarly, some concerns operating roasting establish- ments in Canda, who customarily examine and cup-test in\\n\\nNew York samples of coffee destined for roasting in Canada,\\n\\nhave found it difficult to continue this normal operation in\\n\\ncases where the corresponding coffee quota has been closed.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Agreement was intended to\\n\\naccomplish certain specified objectives through the estab- lishment of a quota system without interfering any more\\n\\nthan might be necessary with the usual and normal operation\\n\\nof the coffee trade. Article XVII of the Coffee Agreement,\\n\\nwhich formally establishes this principle, reads as follows:\\n\\n**The participating Governments agree to\\n\\nmaintain, in so far as possible, the normal and usual\\n\\noperation of the coffee trade.”\\n\\nIn view of the clear purpose and intent of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement, and the fact that the quotas\\n\\nestablished therein are intended to cover only coffee entered\\n\\nfor actual consumption, the Inter-American Coffee Board ex- presses the opinion that the entry of samples for testing pur- poses may properly be considered as falling outside the scope\\n\\n[88]\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX No. 15', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 10\\n\\nJuly 24, 1941\\n\\nof the quotas and accordingly may be permitted even in\\n\\ncases where the corresponding quota has been closed.\\n\\nIt is apparent that if this procedure is to be adopted ade- quate safeguards must be established by regulation in order\\n\\nto prevent abuses. The Board is confident that practical\\n\\nmeasures of accomplishing the objective may be adopted\\n\\nwithout in any way weakening the strict enforcement of\\n\\nthe quotas.\\n\\n[89]\\n\\nresolution urging MAINTENANCE OF MARI- TIME FACILITIES FOR THE SHIPMENT OF\\n\\nCOFFEE TO THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1. Coffee is the most important single commodity im- ported by the United States from the other American repub- lics, and represents one of the basic articles of consumption in\\n\\nthe United States;\\n\\n2. The economic welfare and prosperity of many of the\\n\\nAmerican republics depend in large measure on the coffee\\n\\ntrade;\\n\\n3. Under the terms of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment over 97% of all imports of coffee into the United\\n\\nStates come from the other American republics;\\n\\n4. The Inter-American Coffee Agreement is intended\\n\\nto stabilize the coffee market on terms fair to producers and\\n\\nconsumers alike;\\n\\n5. Uncertainties regarding the present and prospective\\n\\nshipping facilities for transporting this important commodity\\n\\nto the United States may create fear, undermine confidence\\n\\nand promote speculation, to the detriment of the announced\\n\\npurposes of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement;\\n\\n6.

The preamble of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, which sets forth in general terms the broad objectives\\n\\nof the Agreement, states that **it is necessary and desirable\\n\\nto take steps to promote the orderly marketing of coffee, with\\n\\na view to assuring terms of trade equitable for both pro- ducers and consumers by adjusting the supply to demand”;\\n\\n2. The statement by the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nof its pohcy regarding prices and consumption, dated April\\n\\n17, 1941, reiterates that ”the purpose of the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement is to make possible the orderly marketing\\n\\nof coffee under the extraordinary conditions which have re- sulted from the present world conflict”;\\n\\n3. Recent developments in the coffee market of the\\n\\nUnited States, which have been caused in some measure by\\n\\nofficial acts not contemplated in the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement, threaten to disrupt orderly marketing conditions\\n\\nand the normal business of coffee roasting establishments\\n\\nthroughout the United States, and are making it difficult\\n\\nfor many of these establishments to satisfy their normal re- quirements except on terms of trade considered inequitable;\\n\\n4. Although it appears that stocks of coffee within the\\n\\nUnited States may be ample at the present time, there is\\n\\n[92]\\n\\nreason to believe that these stocks are closely held, partly for\\n\\nspeculative purposes, with the result that there is a corre- sponding scarcity of coffee freely offered on equitable terms\\n\\nin the United States market;\\n\\n5. In certain individual cases roasters are confronted with\\n\\nan actual scarcity of certain types of coffee due to the fact\\n\\nthat the corresponding quotas have been closed prior to the\\n\\narrival of shipments purchased by these roasters in good faith\\n\\nfor their normal requirements during the current quota year;\\n\\n6. Article XVII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment requires the participating governments to maintain, in\\n\\nso far as possible, the normal and usual operation of the coffee\\n\\ntrade;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1.

The Board believes that, as a matter of policy\\n\\nwhich will facilitate the smooth operation and administra- tion of the Agreement, any such minimum prices which\\n\\nexist or which may be established in the future should not\\n\\nbe maintained or fixed at levels exceeding the market prices\\n\\nfor coffee which would exist under the normal operation of\\n\\nthe quota system in the absence of such minimum prices,\\n\\nnor should they prevent normal price fluctuations, nor dis- turb the normal and usual operation of the coffee trade.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board likewise considers that\\n\\nthose countries having adequate warehousing facilities in their\\n\\nrespective ports of shipment should maintain in those ports\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX No. 19', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 18\\n\\nOctober 23, 1941\\n\\n[96]\\n\\nstocks of coffee in quantities sufficient to satisfy the require- ments of the market, in order to facilitate the normal and\\n\\nusual operation of the coffee trade.\\n\\nIn view of the unanimous agreement which has been\\n\\nreached on the foregoing points, the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard believes that the successful operation of the Inter- American Coffee Agreement is assured, and that there will\\n\\nbe a normal and regular movement of coffee to the United\\n\\nStates on terms fair to producers and consumers alike.\\n\\n[97]\\n\\n/ ,\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX No. 20', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 18\\n\\nOctober 23, 1941\\n\\nRESOLUTION READJUSTING THE QUOTAS FOR\\n\\nTHE UNITED STATES MARKET\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\nFor the purposes of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment it is necessary, because of the special circumstances now\\n\\nexisting, to adjust the quotas for the United States market;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1.

On December 11, 1941 the Office of Price Adminis- tration of the United States of America, taking account of\\n\\nthe present critical emergency situation, fixed a tentative list\\n\\nof maximum prices for green coffee in the United States mar- ket, taking as a basis the prices which prevailed in New York\\n\\non December 8 of this year;\\n\\n2. The Government of the United States has invited the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Board to consider the problems\\n\\nthereby created and to contribute its views regarding the best\\n\\nmethods of dealing with them;\\n\\n3. The Inter-American Coffee Board, confronted by the\\n\\nnew situation which has been created, and cognizant of its\\n\\nresponsibilities, desires to lend its full cooperation in the study\\n\\nof the problem, with the purpose of assuring the orderly\\n\\nmarketing of coffee in accordance with the purposes of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement;\\n\\n[100]\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1.

C.\\n\\nA.\\n\\n1. The issuance of a price order on green coffee by the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration follows directly from the duty\\n\\nof this Office of preventing any interference with the war\\n\\neffort of the United States that might arise from price in- creases. It is essential to high civilian morale that the supply\\n\\nof food be adequate and available to consumers at reasonable\\n\\nprices. Coffee is one of the most essential of foods; among\\n\\nadults it is the leading food beverage consumed in this coun- try and its stimulating character makes it especially desirable\\n\\nin times of emergency.\\n\\n2. In the last eighteen months the prices of green coffees\\n\\nhave shown very large increases, the prices of some grades\\n\\nhaving more than doubled. Although prices seemed to have\\n\\nbecome stabilized in the last month, the outbreak of the\\n\\nwar on December 7 created a situation in which the infla- tionary tendencies in the price of coffee might again be\\n\\nintensified. Therefore, in order to prevent further infla- tionary increases, the price of coffee was frozen at the\\n\\nlevels prevailing on December 8.\\n\\n\", 'APPENDIX No. 23', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 21\\n\\nDecember 26, 1941\\n\\n[102]\\n\\n3. Although the establishment of a price ceiling for\\n\\ncoffee was dictated by the lines of internal policy, it is clear\\n\\nthat such an action has international repercussions. It is\\n\\nclear also that it is equally to the advantage of both the\\n\\nexporting countries and the United States that the orderly\\n\\nmarketing of coffee be maintained under the ceiling order.\\n\\nThe cooperation of all parties is essential to this end, and\\n\\nit is the opinion of the Office of Price Administration that\\n\\nsuch cooperation can best be implemented by contact be- tween the Office of Price Administration and the Inter- American Coffee Board.\\n\\nB.\\n\\n4. In line with this policy representatives of the Office\\n\\nof Price Administration met with Mr. Paul Daniels, repre- senting the Inter-American Coffee Board, on December 22.\\n\\nAt this meeting Mr. Daniels presented several factors which\\n\\nthe Board felt should be considered in the revision of the\\n\\nprice schedule on green coffee. These considerations are dis- cussed in the five paragraphs immediately following.\\n\\n5. It has been suggested that the ceiling prices be based\\n\\non a fixed price f.o.b. export points. The Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration has no authority to fix prices anywhere ex- cept in this country. However, sufficient flexibility in the\\n\\nceiling price to take care of increases in freight, marine in- surance, and war risk insurance rates is desirable from sev- eral points of view. Also there is equity in the claim that\\n\\nthe producing countries should not bear the burden of such\\n\\nincreases, since these rates are beyond the control of the pro- ducing countries. With these considerations in mind, the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration has inserted in the draft of\\n\\nthe amendment to Price Schedule No. 50 (Subsection 1351.1\\n\\n(g), a copy of which has been forwarded, a provision which\\n\\nhas the effect of establishing fixed prices f.o.b. export points.\\n\\n[103]\\n\\n6. Another consideration offered by the Board relates to\\n\\ncost of production. The estimation of cost of production\\n\\ndata for agricultural products is extremely difficult. How- ever, since fixed costs are such a large proportion of the\\n\\ntotal cost of production, it is hardly possible that unit costs\\n\\nof producing coffee have risen to levels that are not more\\n\\nthan covered by the current level of ceiling prices. Until\\n\\nsuch time as reliable data shows that payments to growers\\n\\nhave been increased in greater proportion than the increase\\n\\nin coffee prices, an increase in the ceiling cannot be justified\\n\\non this basis.\\n\\n7. A similar response is indicated in considering increases\\n\\nin the prices of articles imported by the producing coun- tries from the United States. The ceiling prices currently\\n\\nestablished offset by many times increases in prices of articles\\n\\nexported from the United States. From data published by\\n\\nthe United States Department of Commerce, it is found\\n\\nthat from the first half of 1940 to July, 1941 (the last date\\n\\nfor which the information is published) the prices of fin- ished manufacturers exported from the United States have\\n\\nshown no net increase. Prices of semi-manufacturers have\\n\\nincreased by only 8 percent. These classes form the bulk of\\n\\nour exports to Latin America. Among the other export\\n\\nproduct groups only the prices of manufactured foodstuffs\\n\\nhave increased as much as 20 percent. Against this the ceil- ing prices for Santos No. 4,and for Manizales are in the\\n\\nneighborhood of 80 percent above their levels in the first\\n\\nhalf of 1940. Further, the change in Brazil’s balance of\\n\\ntrade from an unfavorable to a substantially favorable one\\n\\nhas been attributed by Brazil to the increase in the price\\n\\nof coffee.\\n\\n8. The Board has suggested that the ceiling prices be\\n\\n[104]\\n\\nbased on an average of prices over a period of time rather\\n\\nthan on the prices as of a single day. The objective of the\\n\\noriginal schedule was to prevent the development of run- away prices in the coffee market. For this purpose, a date\\n\\npreceding the development of the speculative advance is\\n\\nfully as adequate as the use of any average price. Revisions\\n\\nof the prices prevailing as of the freezing date, when basic\\n\\nconditions warrant, have always been part of Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration policy. As to differentials, the amended\\n\\norder contains the unanimous recommendations of the trade,\\n\\nwhich reflect experience over an extended period of time.\\n\\n9. Finally, the Board mentioned that the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration consider allowing a 25-point tolerance above\\n\\nthe ceiling level. It is assumed that this recommendation\\n\\nwas aimed at securing more flexibility in the ceiling. This\\n\\nhas been attained by the amended order, which permits trad- ing above the ceiling in the event of increases in freight and\\n\\ninsurance.\\n\\n10. Several courses of action are being followed by the\\n\\nOffice of Price Administration in order to maintain the\\n\\norderly marketing of coffee and to insure the maintenance\\n\\nof trading and import in satisfactory volume. All of these\\n\\nare at present embodied in the draft of the amendment to\\n\\nPrice Schedule No. 50, which is attached, and of these, two\\n\\nare particularly important. The first is the provision ef- fecting flexibility in the price ceilings to cover increases in\\n\\nfreight and insurance rates. This is discussed in paragraph\\n\\n5 above.\\n\\n11. The second important amendment is in subsection\\n\\n1351.1 (c) which extends the list of types and grades of\\n\\ncoffee for which specific ceilings are stated and which estab-\\n\\n[105]\\n\\nlishes differentials between these types somewhat different\\n\\nfrom those established by the original price schedule. The\\n\\nprice differentials upon which the amended price schedule\\n\\nis based were submitted to the Office of Price Administration\\n\\nby representatives of all branches of the green coffee trade\\n\\nat a meeting in New York on December 18. These repre- sentatives agreed unanimously upon the fairness of the dif- ferentials they submitted and pointed out that the differen- tials which had prevailed over a long period of time had\\n\\nbeen considered. In the face of such unanimity and in view\\n\\nof the fact that such differentials are in accord with the\\n\\nanalysis made by members of the staff of the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration, it is believed that they should be embodied\\n\\nin the amended schedule.\\n\\n12. It is important to the coffee-producing countries and\\n\\nto the United States that the free movement of coffee be\\n\\nmaintained at this time, particularly in view of the possi- bility that shipping shortages may limit shipments later in\\n\\nthe season. In these circumstances the Inter-American Cof- fee Board can contribute to the attainment of this objective\\n\\nby continuing to bring to the attention of the Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration considerations affecting operation of the ceil- ing price schedule; and by continuing its adherence to the\\n\\nprinciples expressed in previous resolutions and declarations,\\n\\nparticularly those of October 23, 1941. The Office of Price\\n\\nAdministration further suggests that the orderly marketing\\n\\nand the continuation of a satisfactory volume of coffee trad- ing would be significantly assisted at this time by the issu- ance of a statement by the Board expressing the view that\\n\\nthe revised price order offers a sound basis for trading in\\n\\ncoffee under present conditions.\\n\\n[106]\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING THE\\n\\nREVISED ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF PRICE ADMIN- ISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES DATED\\n\\nDECEMBER 27, 1941, ESTABLISHING NEW\\n\\nPRICE SCHEDULE FOR GREEN COFFEE\\n\\nIn pursuance of the resolution approved by the Inter- American Coffee Board at its meeting of December 18,\\n\\n1941, the Board has been in touch with the officials of the\\n\\nUnited States Government concerned with emergency\\n\\nmeasures of price control. This contact has afforded an\\n\\nopportunity for certain considerations of importance to the\\n\\nBoard to be brought before these officials, as a contribution\\n\\nto the study which has been made of this important problem.\\n\\nIn the revised order of the Office of Price Administration\\n\\nof the United States, dated December 27, 1941, amending\\n\\nand amplifying the preliminary order of December 11, the\\n\\nBoard has noted with gratification that its recommendations,\\n\\nand specifically its resolution of December 18, have been\\n\\ntaken into account, and that in the new price schedule which\\n\\nhas been established coffee producers will be protected\\n\\nagainst fluctuations in ocean freight rates and charges for\\n\\nmaritime insurance and war risk insurance over which they\\n\\nhave no control.\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board believes that the re- vised price schedule of December 27, 1941, establishes a\\n\\nsound basis for trading in coffee under present conditions.\\n\\nIt is accordingly hoped that there will be a continuation\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 24', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 21\\n\\nDecember 26, 1941\\n\\n[107]\\n\\nof a satisfactory volume of coffee trading, in accordance with\\n\\nprevious resolutions and declarations of the Board, partic- ularly those of October 23, 1941.

In order to obviate any obstacle which\\n\\nmight interrupt the flow of coffee to the United States in\\n\\nthese times, the Board declares that it intends to remove\\n\\nthe limit of 15%, if it should become an obstacle.

For your further\\n\\ninformation I am likewise enclosing a copy of my reply of\\n\\ntoday’s date.\\n\\nI believe you will agree that current conditions in the\\n\\nfield of maritime transportation are completely different\\n\\nfrom those existing in normal times which justify the estab- lishment of shipping conferences and the limitations and\\n\\nrestrictions pertaining thereto.

Such action would in\\n\\nnowise involve any discussion of the conference principle in\\n\\ngeneral and its basic justification, but rather would be merely\\n\\nan emergency measure to facilitate the movement of coffee\\n\\nto the United States at a time when all shipping should be\\n\\nused to the fullest extent possible.\\n\\nSince this matter is of interest and importance to all\\n\\nthe coffee-producing countries, it would be preferable if\\n\\nyour reply to this inquiry could cover not only the Camexco\\n\\nFreight Conference, but likewise any other shipping\\n\\nconference engaged in the movement of coffee from the\\n\\nother American republics to the United States.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\n(Sgd.)

GRACE COOPERATED EFFECTIVELY.\\n\\nCONSALVA\\n\\nAs these steps were being taken, and since we could not\\n\\noffer any assurance as to their success, the vessel finished its\\n\\nrepairs and sailed from Cutuco on the night of the 18th.\\n\\nIn view of this we requested that the corresponding author- ities sent a radiogram to the ship instructing it to return to\\n\\nLa Union, which message was sent according to information\\n\\nreceived from our Consul in San Francisco. Since, as we\\n\\nunderstand, all ships have orders not to act on messages re- ceived on the high seas, we awaited the return of the ship\\n\\nfor several days with the coffee on dock ready to load imme- diately. For one reason or another the ship did not return,\\n\\nand the entire shipment is still at the port awaiting the\\n\\narrival of some ship sailing North. We wish to bring to\\n\\nyour attention the fact that the last ship sailing in that\\n\\ndirection which called at Cutuco came on February 4th last,\\n\\nand that to this date we know of no other liner which is to\\n\\ncall at this port in the future.\\n\\nSince then we have received correspondence from our\\n\\nConsul in San Francisco, giving a detailed account of the\\n\\nsteps taken in that city, and find in our correspondence the\\n\\nfollowing letter from the Camexco:\\n\\n\\'•CAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE—SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,\\n\\nFEBRUARY 19, 1942—HONORABLE JORGE RAMIREZ, CONSUL GEN- ERAL OF EL SALVADOR, RUSS BUILDING, SAN FRANCISCO, CALI- FORNIA.\\n\\nDEAR MR. RAMIREZ: THIS WILL CONFIRM OUR TELEPHONE\\n\\nCONVERSATION OF TODAY WHEREIN WE ADVISED YOU THAT\\n\\nCAMEXCO FREIGHT CONFERENCE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SIGNA- TORIES TO ITS FREIGHTING AGREEMENTS USING FACILITIES OF\\n\\nTHE SS \"MAGISTER”, A NON-CONFERENCE VESSEL NOW AT LA\\n\\nUNION, EL SALVADOR, FOR THIS ONE VOYAGE, FOR THE TRANS-\\n\\n[114]\\n\\nPORTATION OF GREEN COFFEE FROM THE PORTS OF LA UNION\\n\\nAND LA LIBERTAD, EL SALVADOR, TO NORTH PACIFIC COAST\\n\\nPORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. WE TRUST THE\\n\\nACTION ON THE PART OF THIS CONFERENCE WILL BE OF SERVICE\\n\\nTO YOU. YOURS VERY TRULY, (S) C R. KING, CHAIRMAN- SECRETARY.\\n\\nAs may be gathered from the letter quoted above, the\\n\\nauthorization for using ships belonging to companies which\\n\\nare not affiliates of the Conference was granted only for the\\n\\nparticular case for which it was requested. We are, there- fore, still unable to utilize any space which might become\\n\\navailable if a ship not affiliated to the Conference should call,\\n\\nsince the request for permission takes time and it would not\\n\\nbe unlikely that, by the time the authorization is obtained, the\\n\\nship should have left our shores as in the case of the **MAG- ISTER”.\\n\\nOn this very date the selfsame situation has come up\\n\\nagain. We are acting in San Francisco to obtain authoriza- tion from the CAMEXCO to utilize the facilities offered by\\n\\nan oil tanker to carry North from 15,000 to 18,000 bags.\\n\\nOf course, in this case, besides the authorization of the Con- ference we must obtain that of the importers who, although\\n\\nthe holds of the ship are perfectly clean, might fear lest the\\n\\ncoffee should suffer by being stored near petroleum. Never- theless, it would be easier to operate if we had to consult\\n\\nthem only without having to wait until after the Confer- ence has given its decision.\\n\\nWe have taken the liberty of bringing to your attention\\n\\nthis lengthy exposition in order to acquaint you perfectly\\n\\nwith the circumstances, to see if there is anything which\\n\\nmight be done to alleviate the difficulties besetting maritime\\n\\ntransportation.\\n\\n[115]\\n\\nWe believe that the Conference should be less exacting\\n\\nin these times of emergency, inasmuch as it is not able to\\n\\nserve the ports of these countries regularly with ships of its\\n\\naffiliated companies. Moreover, aside from the transporta- tion of coffee, it is a pity to see ships with available space,\\n\\nwasting time, fuel and money—precious in these moments—\\n\\nwhile shipments are left along their route, which might\\n\\neasily be transported were it not for hindrances and obli- gations which, however justifiable they may be in normal\\n\\ntimes of close competition, are obstacles in crises so acute as\\n\\nthe present one.\\n\\nIn other words, we would desire that efforts be made\\n\\nto obtain full authorization from the Maritime Conferences\\n\\nto employ all facilities which may be available for the trans- portation of freight which lies in wait for ships in our ports.\\n\\nIn various instances recommendations have been made to\\n\\nthe producing countries to take advantage of all shipping\\n\\nfacilities to ship to the United States as much coffee as pos- sible in the briefest time possible. We are trying to coop- erate in every way towards that end, and, for that reason,\\n\\nare anxious to eliminate the difficulties which exist by reason\\n\\nof technicalities.\\n\\nWith expressions of our highest consideration and per- sonal esteem, we are.\\n\\nYours very truly,\\n\\n(Sgd.)

The recommendations, if in favor of con- tinuation, may suggest amendments to the Agreement.\\n\\nEach participating Government shall signify to the\\n\\nBoard its acceptance or rejection of the recommendations\\n\\nreferred to in the immediately preceding paragraph within\\n\\nsix months after the date of the receipt of such recom- mendations. This period may be extended by the Board.\\n\\nIf said recommendations are accepted by all the par- ticipating Governments, the participating Governments\\n\\nundertake to take such measures as may be necessary to\\n\\ncarry out said recommendations. The Board shall draw\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 29', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\n[118]\\n\\nup a declaration certifying the terms of said recommenda- tions and their acceptance by all the participating Gov- ernments, and the present Agreement shall be deemed to\\n\\nbe amended in accordance with this declaration as from\\n\\nthe date specified therein. A certified copy of the decla- ration together with a certified copy of the Agreement as\\n\\namended shall be communicated to the Pan American\\n\\nUnion and to each of the participating Governments.\\n\\nThe same procedure for making amendments or for\\n\\nthe continuation of the Agreement may be followed at\\n\\nany other time.”\\n\\nThe foregoing Article, and the procedure which it con- templates, make it necessary to give attention to two major\\n\\nproblems in connection with the possible renewal of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement: (1) possible changes in\\n\\nthe substance of the Agreement; and (2) the legal prob- lems presented in effecting any changes in the Agreement\\n\\nor in continuing the Agreement without change.\\n\\nWith respect to the first point, namely, possible changes\\n\\nin the substance of the provisions of the Agreement, it is\\n\\nsuggested that each Delegate present to the Board not later\\n\\nthan at the ordinary session of the Board on July 7, his\\n\\nrecommendations regarding possible changes in the substance\\n\\nand text of the Agreement.\\n\\nWith reference to the second point, the views of each\\n\\nparticipating Government should be ascertained and made\\n\\nknown to all of the Delegates as soon as possible. In this\\n\\nconnection consideration should be given, I believe, to the\\n\\nfollowing points:\\n\\n[119]\\n\\n1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board recommends\\n\\nto each participating Government that the Agreement be\\n\\ncontinued for a specified or unspecified period beyond\\n\\nOctober 1, 1943, without any change whatsoever, will it\\n\\nbe necessary for each Government to re-submit the Agree- ment to the National Congress with a view to obtaining\\n\\nCongressional approval?\\n\\n2. If the Board recommends continuation of the\\n\\nAgreement with only very slight changes of a purely\\n\\nphraseological character, not involving any substantive\\n\\nchange in the Agreement, would submission to the Con- gress be necessary?\\n\\n3. If the Board should recommend the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement with important changes of substance,\\n\\nwould Congressional approval be necessary?\\n\\nNo doubt other questions of a legal or technical char- acter will arise in connection with the possible renewal of\\n\\nthe Coffee Agreement, but it would be most convenient if\\n\\nthe foregoing questions could be answered at once. Each\\n\\nof the participating Governments has a direct and immediate\\n\\ninterest in the legal and procedural problems which may be\\n\\nconfronted in all of the other countries, because we all have\\n\\na common interest in the Agreement. If difficulties should\\n\\nbe encountered of a legal or procedural character, causing\\n\\na lapse in the legal force of the Agreement, a most unfor- tunate situation might arise. Accordingly, I urge that this\\n\\nimportant problem be studied urgently by each Delegate in\\n\\norder that the views of all the participating Governments\\n\\nmay be made known to all of us at the earliest possible date.\\n\\n(Sgd.) Paul C. Daniels,\\n\\nChairman\\n\\n[ 120]\\n\\nRESOLUTION REMOVING THE LIMIT OF 15% ON\\n\\nADVANCE SHIPMENTS\\n\\nWHEREAS\\n\\n1. The Inter-American Coffee Board has repeatedly ex- pressed its policy to the effect that full advantage be taken\\n\\nof all shipping space available for the movement of coffee\\n\\nto the United States;\\n\\n2. In a resolution approved by the Inter-American Cof- fee Board on October 23, 1941, authorization was granted\\n\\nby the Board to the producing countries to ship coffee to\\n\\nthe United States in excess of the quotas for the current\\n\\nquota year, under certain conditions, up to a limit of 15%\\n\\nof their respective basic quotas;\\n\\n3. On March 5, 1942, the Inter-American Coffee Board\\n\\nannounced its intention of removing the aforesaid limit of\\n\\n15% if it should become an obstacle to the movement of\\n\\ncoffee to the United States;\\n\\n4. The circumstances outlined in the foregoing para- graph are about to arise;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To remove the limit of 15% on shipments of coffee\\n\\nin excess of existing quotas provided for in the resolution of\\n\\nOctober 23, 1941, maintaining the other provisions of that\\n\\nresolution.\\n\\n2. To communicate this resolution to the Governments\\n\\nof the countries participating in the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement.\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 30', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\n[121]\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 31', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 26\\n\\nApril 29, 1942\\n\\nRESOLUTION REQUESTING PARTICIPATING GOV- ERNMENTS TO STUDY CERTAIN QUESTIONS\\n\\nIN CONNECTION WITH POSSIBLE CON- TINUATION OF THE INTER-AMERI- CAN COFFEE AGREEMENT\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\nThe date is approaching on which the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Board must apply the provisions contained in Article\\n\\nXXIV of the Coffee Agreement;\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nRESOLVES:\\n\\nTo address itself to the Governments through its dele- gates requesting the Governments to transmit in writing\\n\\ntheir points of view regarding the application of the mech- anism established in Article XXIV in relation to the consti- tutional requirements of their respective countries, replying\\n\\nspecifically to the following questions:\\n\\n1. If the Inter-American Coffee Board should rec- onunend to each one of the participating Governments\\n\\nthat the Agreement be continued for a definite or indefi- nite time after October 1, 1943, without changes of any\\n\\nkind, will it be necessary for each Government again to\\n\\nsubmit the Agreement to the National Congress for ap- proval?\\n\\n[122]\\n\\n2. If the Board should recommend that the Agree- ment be continued with slight modifications of phrase- ology but not of substance, would it be necessary to submit\\n\\nit to Congress?\\n\\n3. If the Board should recommend the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement with important changes of substance,\\n\\nwould it be necessary to obtain the approval of the Con- gress?\\n\\n[123]\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE BOARD REGARDING EMER- GENCY INCREASE OF THE COFFEE QUOTAS\\n\\nFOR THE UNITED STATES MARKET\\n\\nThe Inter-American Coffee Board at its regular meet- ing held today approved an emergency increase of the coffee\\n\\nquotas for the United States market, with the understanding\\n\\nthat this increase is to apply solely to the current quota year\\n\\nand that at the commencement of the next quota year the\\n\\nquotas will be adjusted so as to correspond with the esti- mated requirements of the United States market. As a\\n\\nresult coffees which have arrived from a few countries in\\n\\nexcess of the existing quotas may be released from customs\\n\\nsupervision and entered for immediate consumption.\\n\\nThe immediate effect of this resolution will be to relieve\\n\\ncertain coffee importers of small storage charges on these\\n\\ncoffees which otherwise would be held in warehouse under\\n\\ncustoms supervision until next October 1. While these\\n\\ncharges are a relatively minor item in the cost of coffee,\\n\\nthe Board feels that everything possible should be done to\\n\\nremove any unnecessary or avoidable charges on the coffee\\n\\ntrade during these difficult times.\\n\\nAt no time, now or hitherto, have the quotas estab- lished by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement had the\\n\\neffect of preventing the shipment of coffee from producing\\n\\ncountries to the United States. On the contrary, they\\n\\nhave had the effect of greatly stimulating such shipments,\\n\\nwhich in 1941 reached the highest level in history. Advance\\n\\nshipments on next year’s quota to an unlimited amount\\n\\nwere authorized by the Board in its resolution of April 29,\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 32', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 30\\n\\nJuly 15, 1942\\n\\n[124]\\n\\n1942. Accordingly, no increase in the amount of coffee\\n\\nshipped to the United States will result from the current\\n\\nincrease of the quotas, but such coffee as does arrive will\\n\\nbe more readily available for special uses and with somewhat\\n\\nless cost to the importers.\\n\\nIt is impossible for the Board to predict at this time\\n\\nwhether or not a similar increase of the quotas will be nec- essary or desirable before the end of the next quota year.\\n\\nThe decision will be made at that time on the basis of facts\\n\\nand conditions as they then exist, particularly in regard to\\n\\nthe shipping situation. It is the Board’s avowed intention\\n\\nto maintain the basis for the orderly marketing of coffee\\n\\nestablished by the Inter-American Coffee Agreement, and\\n\\nthe action taken today is to be construed as evidence of the\\n\\nBoard’s desire to adapt itself to emergency conditions rather\\n\\nthan as any change in its basic policy.\\n\\nThe newly established quotas for the current quota year\\n\\nending next September 30 are as follows;\\n\\nCountry Quota\\n\\nBrazil 13,772,990\\n\\nColombia 4,668,142\\n\\nCosta Rica 296,242\\n\\nCuba 118,888\\n\\nDominican Republic 177,835\\n\\nEcuador 222,377\\n\\nEl Salvador 935,779\\n\\nGuatemala 793,042\\n\\nHaiti 407,241\\n\\nHonduras 31,689\\n\\nMexico 729,072\\n\\nNicaragua 309,152\\n\\nPeru 37,022\\n\\nVenezuela 431,527\\n\\n[125]\\n\\nRESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AN EMERGENCY\\n\\nINCREASE OF THE QUOTAS FOR THE\\n\\nUNITED STATES MARKET\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1. The current lack of shipping facilities to transport\\n\\ncoffee from the producing countries to the United States\\n\\nin volume sufficient to satisfiy the requirements of the United\\n\\nStates market has created a shortage of coffee in the United\\n\\nStates market.\\n\\n2. By virtue of a resolution approved April 29, 1942,\\n\\nthe Inter-American Coffee Board provided for advance\\n\\nshipments of coffee in excess of existing quotas, such excess\\n\\nshipments to be charged against next year’s quota but to be\\n\\nstored under customs supervision until the beginning of\\n\\nthe next quota year.\\n\\n3. The measures referred to in paragraph 2 above have\\n\\nmade possible the continuous and uninterrupted flow of cof- fee to the United State in so far as the provisions of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement are concerned, but the\\n\\nexisting prohibition against the entry of these excess coffees\\n\\nfor immediate consumption causes small additional storage\\n\\ncharges for the account of the trade and may prevent the\\n\\nprompt and uninterrupted movement of these coffees into\\n\\nthe channels of distribution.\\n\\n4. It is desirable during this period of emergency to\\n\\nadminister the provisions of the Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nAgreement with all possible flexibility, in order to eliminate\\n\\n', 'APPENDIX NO. 33', '\\n\\nMeeting No. 30\\n\\nJuly 15,1942\\n\\n[126]\\n\\nany unnecessary inconvenience or expense to the coffee trade\\n\\nor the consuming public at large.\\n\\n5. It is essential, however, to maintain the procedure\\n\\nfor orderly marketing established by the Inter-American\\n\\nCoffee Agreement, particularly in Articles I and III thereof,\\n\\nand accordingly the emergency quota readjustment ap- proved by this resolution is solely for the current quota\\n\\nyear.\\n\\nTHE INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE BOARD\\n\\nTHEREFORE RESOLVES:\\n\\n1. To increase the quotas for the United States market\\n\\nas of July 16, 1942, to 277% of the basic quotas, in accord- ance with Article VIII of the Inter-American Coffee Agree- ment, so that the quotas for the current year will be as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\nCountry Quota*\\n\\nBrazil 13,772,990\\n\\nColombia 4,668,142\\n\\nCosta Rica 296,242\\n\\nCuba 118,888\\n\\nDominican Republic 177,835\\n\\nEcuador 222,377\\n\\nEl Salvador 935,779\\n\\nGuatemala 793,042\\n\\nHaiti 407,241\\n\\nHonduras 31,689\\n\\nMexico 729,072\\n\\nNicaragua 309,152\\n\\nPeru 37,022\\n\\nVenezuela 431,527\\n\\n• Adjustments have been made for over-and undershipments during the quota year\\n\\n1940-1941.\\n\\n[127]\\n\\n2.

The Inter-American Coffee\\n\\nBoard recommends to each Government that great care be\\n\\nexercised in issuing such certificates, in order to guarantee\\n\\nthe effective administration of the quotas and smooth oper- ation of the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\n[131]\\n\\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article VI of the\\n\\nInter-American Coffee Agreement there have been a few\\n\\ninstances where the export certificates referred to above\\n\\nhave been issued to an amount in excess of the correspond- ing quota as fixed by the Inter-American Coffee Board In\\n\\nsuch cases losses and inconveniences have been incurred by\\n\\ncoffee traders. The Inter-American Coffee Board sincerely\\n\\nregrets any losses or inconveniences which have been or may\\n\\nbe incurred by either exporters or importers as the result\\n\\nof the improper issuance of export certificates. The Board\\n\\nrecommends that in any such cases the interested parties\\n\\ncommunicate directly with the proper officials in the ex- porting country with a view to seeking relief, and is confi- dent that through direct arrangements of this character\\n\\nequitable and mutually satisfactory solutions may be reached.\\n\\nRESOLUTION RECOMMENDING CONTINUATION\\n\\nOF INTER-AMERICAN COFFEE AGREEMENT\\n\\nWITHOUT CHANGE FOR AN ADDI- TIONAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR\\n\\nWHEREAS:\\n\\n1.

The Inter-American Coffee Agreement has pro- duced results which have been beneficial for the interests\\n\\nof the participating countries, and present circumstances\\n\\nrender advisable, for the common benefit, the continuation\\n\\nof the Agreement in order to avoid the disorderly condi- tions which without the functioning of the Agreement would\\n\\ninevitably arise in the coffee market;\\n\\n3.

These may be sum\\xad marized briefly as follows:\\n\\n1. The orderly marketing of coffee with a view to assuring terms of trade equitable for both producers and consumers.\\n\\n2. The maintenance, in so far as possible, of the normal and usual operation of the coffee trade.\\n\\n3. Full cooperation between all the participating countries, with a view to reaching all decisions by unanimous approval.\\n\\n4. Strict compliance by each participating Gov\\xad ernment with its obligations under the Inter-American Coffee Agreement.\\n\\n5. Administration of the Agreement in such a way as to avoid any unnecessary inconvenience to the coffee industry and trade in producing or consuming countries.\\n\\n6. Improvement in the quality of coffee, for the benefit of both producers and consumers.\\n\\n[135]\\n\\n \\n7.

No such increase or decrease shall be made oftener than once every six months nor shall any change at any one time exceed 5 percent of the basic quotas specified in Article I. The total increase or decrease in the first quota year shall not exceed 5 percent of such basic quotas. Any increase or\\n\\ndecrease in the quotas shall remain in effect until superseded by a new change in quotas, and the quotas for any quota year shall be calculated by applying to the basic quotas the weighted average of the changes made by the Board during the same year. Except as provided in Articles IV, V and VII, the percentage of each of the participating countries in the total quantity of coffee which these countries may export to the United States market shall be maintained unchanged.\\n\\nThe Board shall also have the authority to increase or decrease the export quotas for the market outside the United States to the extent that it deems necessary to adjust supplies to estimated requirements, maintaining unchanged the per\\xad centage of each of the participating countries in the total quantity of coffee to be exported to that market, except as\\n\\n[140]\\n\\n \\nArticle V\\n\\nIn view of the possibility of changes in the demand for coffee of a particular origin in the market outside the United States, the Board is empowered, by a two-thirds vote, to transfer, on the request of any participating country, a part of that country*s quota for the United States market to its quota for the market outside the United States in order to bring about a better balance between supply and demand in special types of coffee. In such cases, the Board is author\\xad ized to make up the resulting deficiency in the total quota for the United States market by increasing the quotas of the\\n\\nother producing countries participating in this agreement in proportion to their basic quotas.\\n\\nArticle VI\\n\\nEach producing country participating in this Agree\\xad ment shall take all measures necessary on its part for the execution and operation of this Agreement and shall issue for each coffee shipment an official document certifying that the shipment is within the corresponding quota fixed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\\n\\nArticle VII\\n\\nThe Government of the United States of America shall take all measures necessary on its part for the execution and operation of this Agreement and shall limit, during each quota year, the entry for consumption into the United States of America of coffee produced in the countries listed in Article I to the quotas as established in the said Article or as modified pursuant to other provisions of this Agree\\xad ment, it being understood that notice of any modified quotas will be communicated by the Board to the Govern\\xad ments of the countries participating in this Agreement.\\n\\n[142]\\n\\nThe Government of the United States of America also undertakes to limit the total entry for consumption of coffee produced in countries other than those listed in Article I of this Agreement to a basic annual quota of 355,000 bags of 60 kilograms net or equivalent quantities.

Any member of the Board may request such an increase and the increase may be author\\xad ized by a one-third vote of the Board.\\n\\nWhen, owing to special circumstances, it may be nec\\xad essary for the purposes of the present Agreement to reduce the quotas for the United States market by a percentage greater than that established in Article III, the Inter-Ameri\\xad can Coffee Board shall also have the authority to exceed the percentage of reduction beyond the limits established by the said Article III, provided that this is approved by the unan\\xad imous vote of the Board.\\n\\n[143]\\n\\n \\nArticle IX\\n\\nThe present Agreement shall be under the administra\\xad tion of a Board, which shall be known as the \"Inter-Ameri\\xad can Coffee Board”, and which shall be composed of dele\\xad gates representing the Governments of the participating countries.\\n\\nEach Government shall appoint a delegate to the Board upon approval of the Agreement.
