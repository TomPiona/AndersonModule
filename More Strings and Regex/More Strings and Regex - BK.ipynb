      "public person . . . Each and every prince may therefore be considered in two\r\n",
      "distinct and different ways: as a man and as a sovereign.\r\n",
      "Philip created a distinct institutional setting for each of his two ‘persons’. By the\r\n",
      "1560s, thanks to the elaborate Burgundian etiquette of the Spanish Court, almost\r\n",
      "1,500 persons attended on the king (about 800 in his household, over 200 in the\r\n",
      "stables, more than 100 in the chapel and so on) while hundreds of other officials\r\n",
      "manned the central organs of government: over 100 in the court’s special police\r\n",

      "dependent bureaux, 53 in the council of Castile, 39 in the council of Aragon, 25\r\n",
      "in the council of the Indies, and so on. Such a huge concentration of people — with\r\n",
      "their families, servants and ancillary staff, they may have totalled 4,000 — could\r\n",
      "scarcely travel around in the king’s wake, and so Philip decided to establish a fixed\r\n",
      "centre for his government. He tried out both Valladolid and Toledo, but in June\r\n",
      "1561 opted for Madrid because of its central location, its excellent water supply,\r\n",
      "and its open situation which would enable both the palace and the city to expand\r\n",
      "with minimal difficulty. And expand they did: the surviving registers for six\r\n",

      "As Maria Jose Rodriguez-Salgado has perceptively noted, the king’s decision to\r\n",
      "establish an elaborate Court in Madrid had, as its corollary, the creation of a\r\n",
      "periphery of private retreats to which he could periodically escape and live more\r\n",
      "informally. The king alternated between these two institutional settings. In the\r\n",
      "spacious rooms on the upper floor of the Madrid palace, flanked by his magnificent\r\n",
      "collections of tapestries, paintings and other trappings of Christian kingship, and\r\n",
      "with his ministers toiling on the floor below.\r\n",
      "Plate 6 The Royal Palace, Madrid, c. 1569, by Anton van den Wyngaerde. Philip made Madrid his capital in\r\n",
      "1561 and immediately began to expand the royal palace (Alcazar). Work began almost at once on the ‘Torre\r\n",
      "dorada’ (on the far left), with three high-windowed floors beneath a pointed slate roof in the Flemish style, and\r\n",
      "on the new galleries to the right of the two original towers of the southern facade - constructed according to\r\n",
      "plans amended by the king himself. (Van den Wyngaerde’s sketch shows building still in progress on the ‘Torre\r\n",
      "de la Reina’ at the northeast corner of the complex.) The king enjoyed the views of the Manzanares valley from\r\n",
      "the ‘Golden tower’, and from the rooms along the western facade, where he worked and held audiences while his\r\n",
      "ministers toiled in their offices below.\r\n",
      "He was easily accessible for formal and informal audiences. The king set aside\r\n",
      "part of his day to see people and receive petitions. He made sure that those\r\n",
      "without official business or regular access could approach him on his daily\r\n",
      "walks to and from church. He communicated daily with his advisers and\r\n",
      "councillors. His days were hectic, full of direct pressure, and he dealt with a\r\n",
      "great diversity and quantity of business.^*\r\n",
      "The truth of this emerges from an incident in 1577, while the king was in Madrid.\r\n",
      "Philip’s private secretary asked if Juan Fernandez de Espinosa, one of the financiers\r\n",
      "engaged in a crucial rescheduling of Spain’s debts, might call on him at 2 p.m.,\r\n",
      "but the king protested:\r\n",
      "Let him come at half past three, because it is already two o’clock, and I have no\r\n",
      "time to see the queen and her children except right now. And impress upon\r\n",
      "him that he will have to leave at four, because I have a lot of audiences then —\r\n",
      "even though I have [already] held thirty today. And, in view of that, just look\r\n",
      "at the back-log of papers I shall have!^^\r\n",
      "Naturally, such a frenetic pace could not be sustained indefinitely and the king\r\n",
      "regularly sought solace in one of his country palaces: Aranjuez, Valsam (near\r\n",
      "Segovia), the Pardo and (above all) the Escorial. There, his life — and his style of\r\n",
      "government — took on a totally different aspect. When the same Juan Fernandez\r\n",
      "de Espinosa arrived at Aranjuez bearing a special licence from the council of\r\n",
      "‘The Largest Brain in the World’ 19\r\n",
      "Finance to discuss important business with the king, he received very different\r\n",
      "treatment:\r\n",
      "I do wish that Juan Fernandez had arranged the audience in Madrid, because he\r\n",
      "could have had one there, even though I was busier ... I have brought so many\r\n",
      "papers down here with me that if I start giving audiences I shall not be able to\r\n",
      "think of reading any of them ... I need time and quiet, and with audiences\r\n",
      "believe me I shall have neither.\r\n",
      "The note concluded briskly: ‘I am replying to this now so that Juan Fernandez will\r\n",
      "not be detained in the hope of an audience that I cannot give him.’^^\r\n",
      "Philip’s desire to limit the number of meetings is easily explained. To begin\r\n",
      "with, they could last a long time. Thus in September 1588 Jose de Acosta, SJ,\r\n",
      "received an audience in order to present a lengthy paper on the problems faced by\r\n",
      "the Jesuit Order in Spain. The king read each point, after which Acosta offered\r\n",
      "clarification; sometimes the king asked questions (while speaking of the ‘secretary\r\n",
      "of Father Borgia, the king interrupted and said “Which Father Borgia?” I said\r\n",
      "“The one who was General of our Order”. “You mean Father Francis” said the\r\n",
      "king; “Yes, sire. Father Francisco de Borgia, our General” ’). Acosta’s blow-byblow\r\n",
      "account of the meeting filled four closely written sides of foolscap; it can\r\n",
      "hardly have lasted less than an hour. Nevertheless at the end of it Philip took no\r\n",
      "decision but announced that a particular minister would convey his views at a\r\n",
      "later stage.^^\r\n",
      "Audiences for ambassadors could take just as long and proved no more conclusive\r\n",
      "— the king invariably agreed at the end only to ‘think about it’ — yet with up\r\n",
      "to fourteen envoys resident at the Court, each constantly seeking the chance to put\r\n",
      "the concerns of his principals to the king in person, small wonder that the king\r\n",
      "sometimes complained that ambassadors’ visits had ‘made me waste the day’.^^\r\n",
      "Yet diplomatic audiences could not be entirely avoided: most of them took place\r\n",
      "because a foreign government instructed its representative to explain a particular\r\n",
      "policy, to seek clarification of Spain’s intentions, or to protest against one of\r\n",
      "Philip’s actions - and to do it in person. The king might procrastinate, but\r\n",
      "eventually the ambassador had to be both seen and heard. Sometimes, indeed, the\r\n",
      "occasion could be exploited in order to obtain or impart information. Thus on 31\r\n",
      "October 1571 Ambassador Dona received a full description from Venice of the\r\n",
      "victory of Lepanto three weeks before. He hurried to see the king, who happened\r\n",
      "to be in his chapel, and told a courtier his business; Philip at once invited him to\r\n",
      "sit in the same pew. ‘Straight after the incense’. Dona gave him the news, to which\r\n",
      "the king listened attentively, and they then knelt side by side as the palace choir\r\n",
      "sang the Te Deum ‘with the most beautiful harmony I ever heard’. Philip kept the\r\n",
      "ambassador with him for the rest of the day in order to make sure of every detail.\r\n",
      "Another use of audiences emerged a few days later when Ambassador Fourquevaux\r\n",
      "of France came to complain about the conduct of his Spanish counterpart in Paris.\r\n",
      "Philip listened attentively, but then began to grill Fourquevaux on some recent\r\n",
      "20\r\n",
      "rumours: was it true that Jeanne d’Albret, queen of Navarre, had set out from her\r\n",
      "Court at Pau on a journey to Paris to meet with Charles IX? Was Louis of Nassau\r\n",
      "(Orange’s brother) among her entourage? Fourquevaux had to answer both questions\r\n",
      "affirmatively, and perhaps rashly ventured that several leading Huguenots\r\n",
      "wanted to persuade the king of France to accept Louis into his service, since he was\r\n",
      "a German prince who held no territory in Philip’s dominions. No doubt, Philip\r\n",
      "replied, the leading Huguenots wanted Charles IX to do many foolish things, but\r\n",
      "he reminded Fourquevaux that Louis had waged open war against him in the\r\n",
      "Netherlands in 1568, with the clear implication that Charles should therefore\r\n",
      "send him away.^^\r\n",
      "Normally, however, Philip said virtually nothing at audiences — Dona, who\r\n",
      "wrote down every word in his subsequent reports to the Doge and Senate of\r\n",
      "Venice, seldom recorded more than one sentence (‘although, as usual, his words\r\n",
      "were most gracious’) - but this taciturnity may have stemmed from the fact that\r\n",
      "the king sometimes had difficulty in remembering what people said to him at\r\n",
      "formal encounters. When turning down yet another request for a personal meeting\r\n",
      "he confided one day to his secretary: ‘I can remember little from audiences -\r\n",
      "although do not tell anyone that! I mean from most of them.’ Furthermore,\r\n",
      "written requests gave him more time to consider the best response.Whenever\r\n",
      "he could, therefore, the king preferred communications from others in writing.\r\n",
      "When a prominent nobleman asked to see him, Philip replied: ‘If you were closer\r\n",
      "to Court, it might be appropriate to hear the details from you in person, but\r\n",
      ". . . since you can write securely [a letter} for my eyes alone, I think it would\r\n",
      "be best if you did so’.^^ Shrewd ambassadors indulged the king’s preference.\r\n",
      "Fourquevaux, for example, sometimes ignored commands from his master to seek\r\n",
      "an audience with Philip, especially in summer: ‘I know that I would please him\r\n",
      "more if I communicated with him by letter,’ he explained, because ‘he prefers\r\n",
      "ambassadors to deal with him by letter rather than in person while he resides in\r\n",
      "his country houses’.\r\n",
      "Not everyone proved so tactful. Philip’s understandable desire to protect his\r\n",
      "privacy equally understandably infuriated some of those who wanted to see him\r\n",
      "but could not. It was all very well, lamented the nuncio (dean of the diplomatic\r\n",
      "corps), for the king to insist on receiving requests for action in writing, provided\r\n",
      "he then replied to them; but ‘It is rather irritating to have the king living so close\r\n",
      "{at the Escorial}, and not occupied with anything important [!}, and yet for four\r\n",
      "months I have been unable to secure an audience and I have received an answer\r\n",

      "appointed to introduce double-entry book-keeping into the Castilian treasury, the\r\n",

      "Philip dismissed this out of hand: ‘{Speaking} as one who has already almost 33\r\n",

      "to them and then see them again to give a response — especially those like Avalos\r\n",
      "who talk all the time.’^° A few years later, a courtier suggested that the king\r\n",
      "should spend twice as long listening as he spent writing; while Cardinal\r\n",

      "although both men served on the council of State, and the secretary of the council\r\n",

      "Don Luis de Requesens, governor-general of the Netherlands (the most powerful\r\n",

      "chaplain), left the Court and another, Gabriel de Zayas (also a cleric and Perez’s\r\n",

      "of Italy), refused to speak with him when they met in the palace. The impasse only\r\n",
      "ended with Perez’s dismissal.^^^ Even given harmonious relations between ministers,\r\n",
      "so many persons reported directly and separately to the king that confusion\r\n",
      "could easily arise. According to one adviser, in 1565:\r\n",
      "His Majesty makes mistakes, and will continue to make mistakes, in many\r\n",
      "matters because he handles them with different people, sometimes with one, at\r\n",
      "other times with another, concealing something from one minister but revealing\r\n",
      "other things. It is therefore small wonder that different and even contradictory\r\n",
      "orders are issued ... It cannot fail to cause grave problems for the conduct\r\n",
      "of business and many inconveniences.\r\n",
      "In the course of his reign Philip introduced certain procedures to deal with\r\n",
      "these various defects. Eirst, a number of key advisers served on several councils -\r\n",
      "a position on both State and War, or on Indies and Einance, was common; a seat\r\n",
      "on State, War and Finance was not unknown — so that they knew what was\r\n",
      "happening in other advisory bodies and could, at least in theory, help to coordinate\r\n",
      "affairs. For example Francisco de Erasso, who had served the Spanish\r\n",
      "Habsburgs for thirty years, had by 1559 become the secretary of no fewer than six\r\n",
      "councils and a member of two more. Such overlaps served a useful purpose\r\n",
      "26\r\n",
      "because, otherwise, the councils operated almost entirely in the dark: each body\r\n",
      "dealt directly with the king, without knowing what other organs might be doing.\r\n",
      "Thus, in the felicitous formulation of a modern historian, ‘The council of Finance\r\n",
      "had no idea where the money was going, nor the council of War when it was\r\n",
      ", 49 coming .\r\n",
      "As the volume of incoming papers began to rise, however, the pressure on\r\n",
      "individuals holding many posts, like Erasso, became intolerable and so Philip\r\n",
      "introduced another administrative innovation. Between 1566 and 1572 Cardinal\r\n",
      "Diego de Espinosa, president of the council of Castile and Inquisitor-General,\r\n",
      "became an ‘alter ego’ - in the words of Ambassador Fourquevaux, ‘another king\r\n",
      "in this Court’ - and courtiers advised their friends abroad to run everything of\r\n",
      "importance past Espinosa because ‘he is the man in all Spain in whom the king\r\n",
      "places most confidence and with whom he discusses most business, concerning\r\n",
      "both Spain and foreign affairs’. The cardinal did not sit on many councils,\r\n",
      "however: instead he kept abreast of business through a series of informal committees,\r\n",
      "known as ‘juntas’. Thus in 1571, following the conclusion of the ‘Holy\r\n",
      "League’ with Venice and the Papacy against the Turks, a ‘committee of two’ (one\r\n",
      "of them Espinosa) reviewed all reports arriving from Italy and recommended\r\n",
      "appropriate actions in the naval campaign that culminated in the battle of\r\n",
      "Lepanto. When Espinosa died, ministers speculated on who would succeed to ‘the\r\n",
      "superintendence of matters of war, state and finance, the handling of consultas and\r\n",
      "all the rest of the burden [of business] which the cardinal carried’.^” The king,\r\n",
      "however, decided not to delegate the same degree of power to anyone else. ‘I\r\n",
      "believed that it was right to entrust many matters which concerned my royal office\r\n",
      "to the cardinal’, he informed Espinosa’s successor as president of the council of\r\n",
      "Castile. ‘And perhaps good reasons existed for it then. But experience has shown\r\n",
      "that it was not a good thing; and although it meant more leisure and less work for\r\n",
      "me, I do not think it should be allowed to continue.\r\n",
      "Instead of an ‘alter ego’ or Favourite - the system that his son and grandson\r\n",
      "would later adopt - Philip chose to work after 1572 with a ‘chief of staff’:\r\n",
      "Espinosa’s senior clerk, Mateo Vazquez, almost immediately became the king’s\r\n",
      "private secretary and, for most of the period until 15855 played a leading role in\r\n",
      "deciding what matters should be handled by the juntas - for that part of\r\n",
      "Espinosa’s system survived him — and who should serve on them. He also often\r\n",
      "acted as their secretary and arranged both their timetable and their agenda.^^ In\r\n",
      "addition, Vazquez handled the king’s extensive ‘private’ correspondence. Vazquez\r\n",
      "sometimes received orders to drop everything and read important incoming\r\n",
      "papers at once - ‘Look at these while I eat and take a siesta, and send them to me\r\n",
      "for when I awake, so I can see them and decide what to do about them’ — because\r\n",
      "almost from the beginning of his reign Philip allowed his ministers, whether at\r\n",
      "Court or abroad, to write to him directly if they had a problem that they deemed\r\n",
      "confidential, in effect short-circuiting the entire central bureaucracy.” He told\r\n",
      "them: ‘You may also put on the envelope “to be placed in the king’s hands”,\r\n",
      "because I have ordered that such letters should be brought to me sealed so that.\r\n",

      "service.\r\n",
      "Inevitably some ministers abused the system but they did not do so for long.\r\n",
      "Thus in 1574 the king sharply rebuked the governor of Milan:\r\n",
      "I told you [when I appointed you] what you might write ‘to be placed in the\r\n",
      "king’s hands’, and it applied only to what I said in that letter. These matters\r\n",
      "should not be confused with those to be handled by the councils, which could\r\n",
      "reply to you better, confining yourself in letters ‘to be placed in the king’s\r\n",
      "hands’ solely to details that could better inform me, and which you can see\r\n",
      "should not be known to others.\r\n",
      "A decade later the king lost his temper with another minister who insisted on\r\n",
      "referring too much to him directly: ‘Sending letters “to be placed in the king’s\r\n",
      "hands” is a terrible thing, because I often lack the time even to open them. In fact\r\n",
      "it only serves to slow business down, because I have had these two letters for days\r\n",
      "but have only been able to open them now.’ ^Nevertheless when in the following\r\n",
      "year a senior minister suggested discontinuing the practice, the king refused: it\r\n",
      "played a vital role in preventing any attempt by senior advisers to manipulate his\r\n",
      "access to information.^^\r\n",
      "The king was prepared to read almost anything that came across his desk,\r\n",
      "whether or not he had asked for it, and some unsolicited information and advice\r\n",
      "- often from people (especially clerics) not directly involved in government —\r\n",
      "clearly influenced his subsequent decisions. Perhaps the most spectacular example\r\n",
      "occurred in 1586, when Bernardino de Escalante, a priest and inquisitor, sent in\r\n",
      "a detailed plan (complete with map) for the overthrow of Elizabeth Tudor that\r\n",
      "later became the blueprint for the entire ‘Enterprise of England’ (see p. 186 and\r\n",
      "Plate 25 below).” The king showed special concern that his subjects in the\r\n",
      "Americas should be able to write to him whenever they chose, ‘so that we can\r\n",
      "receive [their letters] and be informed of what they wish to tell us’, and he\r\n",
      "repeatedly threatened that any official who attempted to withhold or divert a\r\n",
      "letter addressed to the king would be severely punished.The success of\r\n",
      "Geronimo de Mendieta, a Franciscan residing in Puebla (Mexico), in getting a\r\n",
      "dossier concerning the rights of native Americans to the king’s desk in 1588\r\n",
      "testifies to the king’s sincerity in this matter. Mendieta sent his information by a\r\n",
      "special courier, who delivered it (via the commissary-general of the Order in\r\n",

      "I am reliably informed by someone who frequents his private apartments that\r\n",
      "he is never idle, for besides his desire to read himself all the incoming and\r\n",
      "outgoing correspondence of all areas, and from all the ambassadors and ministers\r\n",
      "of his vast dominions . . . , and besides the many prayers which he says,\r\n",
      "he writes every day with his own hand more than a ream of letters, between\r\n",
      "billetes, consultas and orders, which he constantly sends to his councillors,\r\n",

      "time he spends in signing letters, licences, patents and other affairs of grace and\r\n",

      "By this time, the king in fact dictated many of his decisions on consultas (often\r\n",
      "to Mateo Vazquez), adding only his initials, and he used a stamp to sign routine\r\n",
      "correspondence. In 1594 he began to allow his son and heir to sign orders for him,\r\n",

      "Anyone who looks at how I spent today will see that just two men detained me\r\n",

      "the Indies} back to me tomorrow . . . because {just now} my eyes and head\r\n",
      "cannot take any more.^^\r\n",
      "Long before the typewriter, the Xerox machine and the word-processor, Philip\r\n",
      "was drowning in a sea of paper, and as the reign advanced he tried on various lifejackets.\r\n",
      "In the 1560s he instructed his secretaries to make a precis of long letters\r\n",
      "— even from his beleaguered lieutenants in the Netherlands — because he could not\r\n",
      "find time to read them in full. By the 1570s he received as a matter of routine a\r\n",
      "summary of the main points of each letter so he could see at a glance whether he\r\n",
      "wanted to read it. Since the burden of paperwork still increased, however, the\r\n",
      "pressure on the king continued to grow: ‘I have never seen so many papers mount\r\n",
      "up as now,’ he complained in 1584.^^ The following year, therefore, he began to\r\n",

      "30\r\n",
      "rely upon a small permanent ‘steering committee’ of senior ministers to review -\r\n",
      "and above all to condense - the dossiers that required his consideration: at first the\r\n",
      "Junta de Noche (the ‘Committee of the Night’, with Vazquez as secretary), then\r\n",
      "from 1588 the Junta de Gobierno (the ‘Government Committee’) and later the\r\n",

      "from all the councils (except the council of State) and prepared a brief summary,\r\n",
      "together with recommendations, so that the king could immediately see the\r\n",
      "problem, the council’s proposed solution, and his senior advisers’ suggestions for\r\n",
      "action. Those who wrote directly to the king were now urged to ‘use as few words\r\n",
      "as possible’ because he no longer ‘dared to look’ at long papers.^”\r\n",

      "his hands, without him trusting or delegating to anyone - as if he were still forty\r\n",
      "years old.’ He worked with two illuminated clocks ‘day and night always before\r\n",
      "his eyes’ and ‘he lived with such regularity and precision that his daily actions and\r\n",
      "occupations were counted and determined by minutes’. The pressure nevertheless\r\n",
      "remained relentless. One day in 1587 the king lamented that while he had been\r\n",
      "working on one dossier his valets had brought in ‘ten or twelve more’, and in the\r\n",
      "course of four days in 1596 the Junta Grande forwarded to the king no fewer than\r\n",
      "fifty-five consultas, each one requiring numerous decisions.^^ Even in August\r\n",
      "1598, the last month of his life, the king reserved some important decisions for his\r\n",
      "personal attention and, given his utter prostration, serious delays resulted: immediately\r\n",

      "mountain of petitions from individuals which had gone unanswered because of the\r\n",
      "late king’s ‘continuous ailments and other infirmities’.^^\r\n",
      "The balance of evidence nevertheless suggests that, throughout his reign,\r\n",
      "Philip II managed to devote immediate attention to really important items. Thus\r\n",
      "in May 1586, as he struggled to deal with the havoc wrought by Drake’s raid in\r\n",
      "the Caribbean, the king ordered Vazquez to make sure that he saw only papers\r\n",
      "about defence issues ‘rather than about individuals, unless it is something urgent’.\r\n",
      "In June 1588, preoccupied with getting the Armada to sea against England, he\r\n",
      "commanded the council of Finance to discuss ways of finding the necessary funds,\r\n",
      "and ‘to deal with nothing else, and to meet for no other purpose’; and he ordered\r\n",
      "his other ministers in Madrid to ‘moderate their dispatch of papers for some days’.\r\n",
      "If this did not happen, Vazquez should delay all incoming mail ‘until we have\r\n",
      "been able to get on top of these other matters which are so important’.The\r\n",
      "‘priority mail’ system sometimes created its own problems: later that same year\r\n",
      "the king’s spirits sagged when he received a package of papers by express messenger.\r\n",
      "‘These urgent dispatches destroy me’, he sighed, ‘because they stop me\r\n",
      "from doing the things I had planned to deal with today.’ Nonetheless, he handled\r\n",
      "the pressing issues at once, putting his other files to one side.^’^\r\n",
      "Many of the king’s servants remained unsympathetic. Scarcely had Philip come\r\n",
      "to the throne than his cousin and principal military commander, Emmanuel\r\n",
      "Philibert of Savoy, complained that the king tried to do too much in person; and\r\n",
      "The Context of Strategic Culture ‘The Largest Brain in the World’ 31\r\n",
      "in 1571 Don Diego de Cordoba, a prominent member of the king’s entourage,\r\n",
      "regretted that life at Court had degenerated into ‘papers and more papers, and the\r\n",
      "number grows every day’ because the king ‘writes memoranda every hour,\r\n",
      "and even when he is getting up, eating or retiring his [valets} come in with\r\n",
      "papers . . . that, in the end, do not amount to anything’. Three years later, Don\r\n",
      "Diego commented that ‘His Majesty has been working in recent days even more\r\n",
      "than usual in reading and writing papers, until they come out of his backside (may\r\n",
      "Your Lordship forgive me). . . because on Saturday morning at 3 o’clock he had\r\n",
      "terrible diarrhoea’; and when in 1575 rumours spread that the king might lead an\r\n",
      "expedition to Algiers in person, Cordoba fervently hoped he would go, ‘so that for\r\n",
      "a while he would stop working with so many papers. Certainly it is sad to see what\r\n",
      "he is doing to himself’.\r\n",
      "So why did he do it? Philip’s administrative style — with its insistence on keeping\r\n",
      "the central government compartmentalized, on transacting everything in writing\r\n",
      "and on reserving so many matters for his own scrutiny — has drawn much criticism\r\n",
      "from historians as well as from contemporaries. Those with direct experience of\r\n",
      "governing might be less harsh; indeed, many other statesmen have adopted\r\n",
      "similar practices. To take two twentieth-century examples, in the 1930s President\r\n",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt deliberately created overlapping organs of government and\r\n",
      "divided authority among them, often entrusting them to men of clashing temperaments\r\n",
      "in order to ensure both that his subordinates would always turn to him\r\n",
      "for decisions and that he got advance notice of the choices that had to be made. As\r\n",
      "in Philip’s case, this created enormous pressures on the chief executive. Thus\r\n",
      "Roosevelt’s decision to establish two separate agencies to handle new public works\r\n",
      "policies meant that he had to deal with all competing claims, and between 1935\r\n",
      "and 1938 ‘something like a quarter of a million individual projects — ranging\r\n",
      "from suspension bridges to sewing circles — passed . . . across the President’s\r\n",
      "overcrowded desk’. In 1944, when forty-seven war agencies reported directly\r\n",
      "to him, Roosevelt once exclaimed: ‘The details of this job are killing me’; but\r\n",
      "he was prepared to pay that price in order to retain the power to make the\r\n",
      "decisions that mattered to him.^^ Likewise, when Winston Churchill became\r\n",
      "British prime minister and minister of defence in 1940 he introduced several\r\n",
      "administrative procedures that resembled those of Philip II. On the one hand, he\r\n",
      "transacted as much business as possible in writing and ‘spent very little time\r\n",
      "interviewing people . . . [A}11 had to address him in writing, and his replies or\r\n",

      "Let it be very clearly understood that all directions emanating from me are\r\n",
      "made in writing, or should be immediately afterwards confirmed in writing,\r\n",
      "and that I do not accept any responsibility for matters relating to national\r\n",

      "The stream of messages, covering so wide a range of subjects, was like the beam\r\n",
      "of a searchlight ceaselessly swinging round and penetrating into the remote\r\n",
      "recesses of the administration so that everyone, however humble his range or\r\n",
      "function, felt that one day the beam might rest on him and light up what he\r\n",
      "was doing. In Whitehall the effect of this influence was immediate and dramatic.\r\n",
      "The machine responded at once to his leadership.\r\n",
      "Admittedly some of Churchill’s concerns seemed trivial (‘Could trophies taken in\r\n",

      "Philip II ‘there were those who lamented his preoccupation with detail in matters\r\n",
      "great as well as small’.\r\n",
      "The king’s constant ‘preoccupation with detail’ stemmed not only from a desire\r\n",
      "to retain control over decisions, but also from a deep suspicion that his ministers\r\n",
      "would attempt either to deceive him or to withhold unwelcome information.\r\n",
      "Ambassador Dona of Venice warned his masters that ‘by nature, [the king} is both\r\n",
      "very prudent and very suspicious’, and in his ‘Relation’ to the Senate at the end of\r\n",
      "his embassy in 1573 he repeated that Philip never entirely trusted anyone: ‘They\r\n",
      "say that the king suffers from the same malady as his father: that is, suspicion.\r\n",
      "Likewise, Cristobal Perez de Herrera (who had known the king well) claimed\r\n",
      "shortly after the king’s death that Philip ‘was a great friend of secrecy’. Even the\r\n",
      "adulatory biography of Lorenzo van der Hammen - one of the first to be published\r\n",
      "in Spain - admitted that ‘suspicion, disbelief and doubt formed the basis of his\r\n",
      "prudence’.\r\n",
      "Once again, many later statesmen have been praised for showing a healthy\r\n",
      "distrust of their subordinates; others have made serious blunders because they did\r\n",
      "not. An influential and well-informed study of recent occupants of the White\r\n",
      "House states that ‘Presidents are always being told that they should leave details\r\n",

      "In Philip’s case, suspicion and secrecy seemed to become ends in themselves. This\r\n",
      "tendency emerged with particular clarity in the king’s voluminous correspondence\r\n",
      "with Mateo Vazquez: ‘You and I must be like confessors,’ he told Vazquez on\r\n",
      "‘The Largest Brain in the World’ 33\r\n",
      "one occasion, and the ‘arch-secretary’ frequently received orders to transcribe\r\n",
      "documents — even intercepted items not addressed to the king — ‘so that no one\r\n",
      "knows’, or to engage in a secret correspondence with one councillor about the\r\n",
      "conduct of another.Philip once told Vazquez mysteriously that a matter ‘should\r\n",
      "be handled with much secrecy and dissimulation, so that not only will what is\r\n",
      "under discussion not be known, but not even that anything is being discussed’.\r\n",
      "‘Secrecy and dissimulation’ indeed formed one of the commonest expressions\r\n",
      "in the king’s vocabulary, and many people found it frustrating. According to\r\n",
      "Ambassador Fourquevaux:\r\n",
      "He is not a prince who says what is in his heart; rather, he is one of the greatest\r\n",
      "dissimulators in the world. I can certainly say — because his own ministers say\r\n",
      "it — that he knows how to pretend and conceal his intentions better than any\r\n",
      "king ... up to the time and the hour at which it suits him to let them be\r\n",
      "known.®^\r\n",
      "Philip also suspected that his officials, if not subjected to ceaseless supervision,\r\n",
      "might either embezzle money or in other ways abuse their power. Spain already\r\n",
      "possessed two standard procedures to ensure administrative probity. On the one\r\n",
      "hand, ail executive officers had to submit as a matter of routine to a period of\r\n",
      "scrutiny, known as a residencia, immediately after their turn of duty: during this\r\n",
      "public process, which lasted up to two months, anyone could press charges and the\r\n",
      "judge (normally the official’s successor) was obliged to investigate each one. On\r\n",
      "the other hand, whenever the crown suspected malfeasance, it established a more\r\n",
      "systematic and searching review carried out in secret: the visita. A viceroy once\r\n",
      "compared visitas with ‘the little dust storms that commonly blow up in the\r\n",
      "squares and the streets, with no other result than to raise the dirt, straw and other\r\n",
      "refuse there, and let it fall down again on the heads of the people’, but he\r\n",
      "exaggerated: the procedure — or just the threat of one, for a visita could be created\r\n",
      "without warning at any time — undoubtedly helped to deter and discover corruption,\r\n",
      "inefficiency and oppression.The crown exported both processes from Spain\r\n",
      "to the Americas (where over sixty visitas generales of various institutions in the\r\n",
      "colonies took place between 1524 and 1700), to Spanish Italy (Philip ordered a\r\n",

      "These techniques served to maintain relatively high standards among royal\r\n",

      "at least to insinuate that he had ascertained) detailed information even on his\r\n",
      "ministers at Court. According to a papal diplomat, Philip ‘was so well informed\r\n",

      "a professional soldier to his fingertips. Most of the king’s other commanders\r\n",
      "likewise possessed extensive military experience, especially those trained by Alba\r\n",
      "in Italy and the Netherlands, and most of the exceptions were blood relatives\r\n",
      "whom the king evidently assumed would automatically excel in military and\r\n",

      "the Netherlands despite the opposition of the council of State in Madrid on two\r\n",

      "be of service, judging by what I have heard of his person up to now’. When Don\r\n",
      "John died, the king immediately appointed Parma — who had fought at Lepanto\r\n",
      "and elsewhere — to succeed him.^*^^ As commanders, both men triumphantly\r\n",
      "vindicated the king’s expectations (although Philip had taken care to surround\r\n",
      "them with expert advisers). Moreover Philip showed admirable fidelity towards\r\n",
      "those to whom he had entrusted his armed forces. Although he recalled Alba from\r\n",
      "the Netherlands in 1573 when he lost confidence in the duke’s ability to end the\r\n",
      "Dutch Revolt, he resisted pressure to impose some punishment for the ‘excesses’\r\n",
      "alleged against his regime in Brussels; and although many blamed both Parma\r\n",
      "‘The Largest Brain in the World’ 39\r\n",
      "and Medina Sidonia for the Armada’s failure, the king was not amongst them (see\r\n",
      "pp. 229-32 below).\r\n",
      "Philip also spent time ‘coaching’ his chosen subordinates. He recognized that\r\n",
      "a command structure is not a mere piece of architecture but also a collection of\r\n",
      "relationships, and he took great care both to avoid appointing ‘people on whom\r\n",
      "we cannot rely to assist us when need arises’ and to ‘mentor’ those whom he did\r\n",
      "trust. When Parma’s parents both died in 1586, for example, the king wrote a\r\n",
      "warm note of condolence, urging his nephew to ‘accept it with Christian constancy’\r\n",
      "and ‘to look after your own health’, adding in his own hand, ‘Although you\r\n",
      "have lost your parents within such a short time, I am still here to take their\r\n",
      "place’.Such mentoring possessed special importance in Philip’s Monarchy\r\n",
      "because, to save time, he expected his senior officials to move around from one\r\n",
      "posting to another without coming back to Court for a briefing. Admittedly the\r\n",
      "duke of Alba remained at Court for six months after his appointment as governorgeneral\r\n",
      "of the Netherlands in 1566, discussing with the king all aspects of the\r\n",
      "situation and the role expected of him; Viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo delayed his\r\n",

      "exceptions, however. Far more typical was the experience of Don Luis de\r\n",
      "Requesens who in 1571, after serving as Don John’s deputy in the Alpujarras and\r\n",
      "at Lepanto, went directly to govern Lombardy and then on to the Netherlands two\r\n",
      "years later (being told that instructions on how to carry out his most difficult role\r\n",
      "as Alba’s replacement would be waiting for him in Brussels). Likewise\r\n",
      "Requesens’s brother Don Juan de Zuniga served as ambassador in Rome in 1568—\r\n",
      "79 and then as viceroy of Naples in 1579—82 without returning to Spain, and the\r\n",
      "count of Olivares served successively as ambassador in Rome (1582—91), viceroy\r\n",
      "of Sicily (1591—95) and Naples (1595—99) without setting foot in Spain. Even\r\n",
      "within the peninsula, the king saw no need to brief his senior commanders in\r\n",
      "person: Medina Sidonia received orders to travel directly from his home near\r\n",
      "Seville in 1588 to take command of the Armada in Lisbon; like Requesens, he was\r\n",
      "told that he would find full Instructions at his destination.'^‘’^Philip also normally\r\n",

      "Although he went to Andalusia during the Morisco rebellion (1570), Portugal\r\n",
      "after its annexation (1580-83), and Aragon after its revolt (1592), he visited only\r\n",
      "areas in which hostilities had entirely ceased. Admittedly in March 1588 he told\r\n",
      "Medina Sidonia that ‘If I were not needed so much here, to provide what is\r\n",
      "necessary for that [enterprise} and for many other things, I would be very pleased\r\n",
      "to join [the Armada} — and I would do so with great confidence that it would go\r\n",
      "very well for me.This remarkable statement seems to have been pure hyperbole,\r\n",
      "however, intended to encourage a dispirited commander. Philip’s normal\r\n",

      "to lead a military expedition in person:\r\n",
      "The duke must not be present nor even near [his troops}. Although I say this\r\n",
      "partly because I wish him life, and because you need him alive, I believe I am\r\n",
      "more moved by concern for his reputation, for if the enterprise succeeds, he will\r\n",
      "gain as much prestige if he is absent as if he is present (and perhaps even more\r\n",
      "if he is absent); but if he fails in what he plans (which can happen, since these\r\n",
      "things are in the hands of God, not men), then his loss of prestige will be far\r\n",
      "greater if he is present.\r\n",
      "Perhaps: but more successful warlords - including his father Charles V and his\r\n",
      "rival Henry IV in the sixteenth century, Lincoln in the nineteenth, Clemenceau\r\n",
      "and Churchill in the twentieth — have found that there is no substitute either for\r\n",

      "and trust with theatre commanders through regular personal meetings. Without\r\n",

      "Armada to sea on time.\r\n",
      "Naturally, no CEO can be in all places of crisis at once, but (again like other\r\n",

      "mere couriers who knew nothing of the contents.\r\n",
      "This notable change in governmental practice, coupled with the king’s reluctance\r\n",
      "to leave the comfort of his Castilian palaces, deprived him of a vital element\r\n",
      "The Context of Strategic Culture\r\n",
      "41\r\n",
      "of effective decision-making: reliable feedback. Without either seeing for himself,\r\n",

      "dependent on what he was told by the subordinates to whom he had communicated\r\n",
      "the orders (and he did not always listen even to them: see pp. 195-7 below).\r\n",
      "He could therefore never test whether the assumptions on which his decision had\r\n",
      "been made remained valid, or whether they had become obsolete and needed to be\r\n",
      "re-examined. Time and again, ignorance of the facts on the spot caused the king\r\n",

      "Perhaps Philip s greatest failure as a CEO, however, lay in his inability to\r\n",

      "in 1582 and again in 1583 he ordered his treasury officials to prepare an imperial\r\n",
      "budget for the two succeeding years, in order to assure a more stable and\r\n",
      "predictable flow of money to all his undertakings, and he built up a ‘strategic\r\n",

      "overthrow Elizabeth Tudor late in 1585 undermined these prudent measures,\r\n",
      "the Enterprise of England also gave rise to much long-range planning because the\r\n",

      "necessary resources (see Chapter 6 below).\"'Normally, however, Philip complained\r\n",

      "any business papers with him on a trip because ‘my sight is not as good as it used\r\n",
      "to be for reading in a coach’ and ‘I am ashamed to wear glasses in public’. He\r\n",

      "sent recently has cured me’.But, whatever the causes, the consequences of the\r\n",
      "king’s illnesses could be extremely serious, especially as he grew older. Thus in\r\n",
      "February 1587 Philip (almost sixty years old) went to bed, disabled by arthritis,\r\n",
      "and there he stayed until the following July. Even though Drake’s raid on Cadiz\r\n",
      "in April called for urgent measures, Philip’s incapacity dramatically lengthened\r\n",
      "the delays inherent in his administration and by May the pressure of unresolved\r\n",
      "business had become acute. In the revealing phrase of the king’s valet: ‘God grant\r\n",
      "complete health and long life to His Majesty. His pain afflicts me, because when\r\n",
      "he gets it in his leg we feel it in our heads, and everything stops. A few days later,\r\n",
      "the secretary of the council of War, desperately trying to organize not only the\r\n",
      "departure of the Armada but also imperial defence in the wake of Drake’s raid,\r\n",
      "complained bitterly that ‘a lot of time is being wasted in consultations, and His\r\n",
      "Majesty is slow to respond; so we are losing time that cannot be recovered’. He\r\n",
      "suggested that more matters be delegated to his council for decision, ‘because the\r\n",
      "situation is extraordinary and it seems reasonable that the manner of transacting\r\n",
      "business should be extraordinary too’.But nothing seemed to change. In June,\r\n",
      "again according to the king’s valet: ‘My heart melts to see His Majesty so tired and\r\n",
      "weak, and the machinery of state in suspense’; and, two weeks later, ‘His Majesty’s\r\n",
      "eyes are still running, his feet tender, his hand recovering; and the world is\r\n",

      "without you finding out, because I believe that nothing, whether great or small,\r\n",

      "informed of developments. During his campaign to conquer Portugal in 1580, the\r\n",

      "Armada in Lisbon) maintained his own spies in England, and sent their (sometimes\r\n",
      "superior) reports to the king for comparison with those received from his\r\n",
      "ambassador in Paris.\r\n",
      "Philip also expected his ministers abroad to correspond extensively with their\r\n",
      "colleagues. His instructions to a new ambassador to the Court of Savoy in 1595\r\n",
      "stressed not only the need for regular correspondence with Madrid, but for\r\n",
      "‘continual’ contact with the governors of Milan and Franche-Comte, the viceroys\r\n",
      "of Naples and Sicily, the governor-general of the Netherlands, and the Spanish\r\n",
      "ambassadors in Rome, Genoa, Venice and Vienna. Philip prepared a special letter\r\n",
      "for each of these officials, to be sent by the envoy on his arrival in Turin, enjoining\r\n",
      "them in the king’s name to correspond with their new colleague. He also expected\r\n",
      "to receive copies of these exchanges himself.^” Many ministers of the crown in fact\r\n",
      "already possessed good reason to exchange information. Some were close relatives:\r\n",
      "Thomas Perrenot de Chantonnay (Philip’s ambassador in Paris and then Vienna in\r\n",
      "the 1560s) was Cardinal Granvelle’s brother; despite their different surnames,\r\n",
      "Don Luis de Requesens and Don Juan de Zuniga were also brothers and wrote to\r\n",
      "each other several times a month (in 1573’ when the king appointed the former\r\n",
      "to govern the Netherlands, Zuniga drafted the various letters in which his brother\r\n",
      "56 The Context of Strategic Culture 57\r\n",
      "tried to decline the poisoned chalice).Others were clients: when in 1557 Zuniga\r\n",
      "travelled to the Netherlands to serve the king for the first time, Requesens wrote\r\n",
      "a letter asking Granvelle to look after him, since ‘my brother is your great servant,\r\n",
      "and understands very well the obligation that we both have to serve you’. Aspiring\r\n",
      "courtiers later attached themselves to one or other of Philip’s leading Spanish\r\n",
      "advisers, such as Ruy Gomez da Silva, the duke of Alba or Cardinal Espinosa (who\r\n",
      "kept a detailed register of promising young men, noting the names of their\r\n",
      "sponsors and the suitable jobs available).Once appointed, all ‘clients’ made a\r\n",
      "point of keeping their patron well informed. In addition, in the 1560s Alba\r\n",
      "presided over an informal ‘Academy’ in Madrid which counted among its\r\n",
      "members a whole future generation of the king’s servants: Idiaquez, Moura,\r\n",
      "Zuniga, Silva and Olivares (to name just those who appear frequently in these\r\n",
      "pages) all belonged, and they seem to have maintained regular contact with each\r\n",
      "other for the rest of their lives, both in and out of ministerial office.Thus the\r\n",
      "archive of Don Juan de Zuniga, ambassador in Rome and later viceroy of Naples,\r\n",
      "contained thirty boxes of correspondence with his colleagues between 1571 and\r\n",
      "1583; while Philip’s ambassador to the Venetian Republic received over 1,000\r\n",

      "and each one from Sicily to Spain cost 360 (far more than the annual salary of a\r\n",
      "galley captain or a university professor). The total cost of express messengers\r\n",
      "dispatched by the central government averaged almost 3,000 ducats a month\r\n",
      "(equivalent to the wages of an entire infantry regiment) at the beginning of the\r\n",

      "Brussels and Savoy cost almost 1,000 ducats a year by the 1580s. The remuneration\r\n",
      "of couriers normally constituted the largest item in the budget of every\r\n",
      "ambassador.\r\n",
      "Merchants, too, maintained their own communications network and exchanged\r\n",
      "political as well as commercial information. Simon Ruiz of Medina del Campo, for\r\n",
      "example, ran a commercial enterprise which grew tenfold in value between 1561\r\n",
      "and his death in 1597, from 35,000 to 360,000 ducats — relatively modest by the\r\n",
      "standards of the later sixteenth century. Yet his correspondents resided in Portugal,\r\n",
      "the Netherlands, France and Italy (with a few in America and Germany) and\r\n",
      "Ruiz devoted two days of every month - the days before the ‘ordinary couriers’ left\r\n",
      "— to writing and dictating letters that would bring everyone up to date (often\r\n",
      "attaching to each a duplicate of the preceding dispatch, in case it had been lost,\r\n",
      "and sometimes sending up to five copies of important letters by different routes).\r\n",
      "His agents abroad reciprocated faithfully: they normally wrote at least every\r\n",
      "fortnight, with additional express messengers when something important for\r\n",
      "their master’s business cropped up. They also kept in close touch with Philip IPs\r\n",
      "ministers — especially after Ruiz began to lend money to the government in the\r\n",
      "1570s, making it essential to monitor the fortunes of the Monarchy as well as the\r\n",
      "vicissitudes of the market. Their combined efforts eventually generated an archive\r\n",
      "Distance: Public Enemy Number i ?\r\n",
      "of over 50,000 letters at Ruiz’s headquarters in Medina del Campo and created a\r\n",
      "major clearing house for information on which the government could draw. The\r\n",
      "couriers of Ruiz and other merchants, as well as ordinary travellers, might also\r\n",
      "pick up and pass on extra news, much of which also reached the Court and helped\r\n",
      "to inform the king of events.Finally, even though Philip condemned opening\r\n",
      "other people’s letters as ‘a sin again God’, from time to time he sinned himself. He\r\n",
      "occasionally ordered mail to be intercepted and transcribed ‘so that nobody will\r\n",
      "know, and keep a copy in case I should want it’, or ‘without a living soul knowing\r\n",
      "or seeing . . . even though the letters are not for me’, and sometimes even ‘in a\r\n",
      "script that no one will recognize’.In 1590 Spanish agents secured four letters\r\n",
      "sent by the French envoy in Madrid to Henry IV; each was sent to a ‘codebreaker’\r\n",
      "at Court, who forwarded his efforts to Philip.\r\n",
      "Most of these communications concerned time-sensitive material relating to an\r\n",
      "immediate problem, and some feared that they did not provide sufficient information\r\n",
      "for long-term decision-making. According to Fray Geronimo de Mendieta,\r\n",
      "writing from New Spain in the 1560s, ‘Your Majesty is like a blind man who has\r\n",
      "excellent understanding but can only see exterior objects . . . through the eyes of\r\n",
      "those who describe them to you.’^^But this was an overstatement: although Philip\r\n",
      "had never visited the Americas (to which Mendieta specifically referred), between\r\n",
      "1548 and 1559 he had spent a year in Germany, two years in England and almost\r\n",
      "five in the Netherlands (including an extensive tour through almost all the\r\n",
      "provinces). He had also visited Italy and crossed the Alps twice. In addition he\r\n",
      "travelled all over the Iberian peninsula, living (in all) for over three years in\r\n",
      "Aragon and for almost as long in Portugal. The king possessed a prodigious\r\n",
      "memory for what he had read and seen, on which many contemporaries commented,\r\n",
      "which assisted him greatly in keeping up with all the responsibilities of\r\n",
      "his office; and on occasion he used his personal knowledge of far-away people and\r\n",
      "places to devastating effect. When in 1574 the Inquisitor-General tried to dismiss\r\n",
      "some criticisms of the Holy Office, Philip retorted that ‘in the past we all know\r\n",
      "that [abuses] have been numerous, and I can assure you that in Valencia I saw\r\n",
      "them with my own eyes’.\r\n",
      "Philip constantly sought to update and extend his personal knowledge, both\r\n",
      "about his own possessions and about those of his neighbours, ‘through the eyes of\r\n",
      "those who describe them’. By way of example, in June 1588 the king signed a\r\n",
      "typical ‘fact-finding’ enquiry to the viceroy of Mexico. The viceroy had recently\r\n",
      "reminded the king that a special ‘charity tax’ levied on the native population\r\n",
      "financed the work of the friars and others who preached Christian doctrine in the\r\n",
      "countryside, but noted that ‘with the diseases that have occurred among the said\r\n",
      "Indians since the year 1576 a large part of them have died, and although the tax\r\n",
      "yield has fallen and the number of those to be instructed has declined [the\r\n",
      "preachers] enjoy the same remuneration’. The viceroy therefore proposed that the\r\n",
      "stipends paid to the clergy involved ‘should be reduced in proportion to the fall\r\n",
      "in the number of natives’. The king, however, demanded more information on\r\n",
      "58 The Context of Strategic Culture Distance: Public Enemy Number i ? 59\r\n",
      "every aspect of the case before reaching a decision. The fact that Philip and his\r\n",
      "ministers found time to launch this enquiry at a moment when they struggled to\r\n",
      "cope with the crisis caused by the Armada’s unexpected return to Spain after being\r\n",
      "hit by a storm — and anxiously sought to save money wherever possible — is highly\r\n",
      "revealing. Even in 1598, with death fast approaching, the king found time to\r\n",
      "rebuke the viceroy of Portuguese India for failing to send on some letters received\r\n",
      "in Goa from the emperor of Ethiopia, because no one had been able to translate\r\n",
      "them into Portuguese. ‘There is no shortage of people here who can do so,’ he\r\n",
      "wrote irritably, and ordered that any similar communications in the future should\r\n",
      "be forwarded without fail.'^^\r\n",
      "Furthermore Philip could call upon the personal knowledge of his welltravelled\r\n",
      "advisers: ministers Don Luis de Requesens and Ruy Gomez da Silva and\r\n",
      "secretaries Gonzalo Perez and Gabriel de Zayas had all accompanied Philip on his\r\n",
      "Grand Tour of Europe in 1548—51, and all but Requesens had also been with him\r\n",
      "in England; the count of Olivares had been to England, fought in Italy and at St\r\n",
      "Quentin, and carried out a diplomatic mission to France before becoming ambassador\r\n",
      "in Rome, viceroy of Sicily and later Naples, and finally councillor of State;\r\n",
      "Don Juan de Idiaquez had served five years as ambassador in Italy before becoming\r\n",
      "secretary of state; the marquis of Almazan, an outspoken councillor of War, had\r\n",
      "previously represented Philip at the imperial Court and served as viceroy of\r\n",
      "Navarre; and Don Hernando de Toledo, another prominent councillor of War,\r\n",
      "had visited England and Erance, fought in Flanders and Italy, and served as\r\n",
      "viceroy of Catalonia. Francisco de Erasso, the duke of Alba and Cardinal Granvelle\r\n",
      "had all acquired first-hand knowledge of almost every part of western Europe:\r\n",
      "when the king sought advice in 1566 on the best way to travel from Spain to the\r\n",
      "Netherlands, Granvelle described and assessed every possible itinerary, by both\r\n",
      "land and sea, on the basis of his own personal experience.The king and his\r\n",
      "councillors also possessed long institutional memories and frequently cited precedents\r\n",
      "and examples from the past — sometimes going back several decades. When\r\n",
      "in 1559 and again ten years later some suggested that France and Spain should\r\n",
      "conquer England jointly and then partition it, the duke of Alba vetoed the idea\r\n",
      "because ‘recent’ experience had shown that such arrangements would not work: he\r\n",
      "referred to the treaty of Granada in 1500 concerning the partition the kingdom of\r\n",
      "Naples between the two ‘superpowers’.^^\r\n",
      "In addition, Philip set out systematically to collect new data about his possessions.\r\n",

      "system’ (p. 30 above). The king knew that he lacked the time to take care of\r\n",

      "(albeit with characteristic prolixity):\r\n",
      "You can tell him that you have reminded me [about this} several times, and\r\n",
      "that I very much wanted to see it; but that getting the Armada in Portugal to\r\n",

      "none, thanks to his unique information network he alone could appreciate the\r\n",

      "of the Armada, that ‘the success and failure of an enterprise is decided by\r\n",
      "days and hours’ and urged him to ‘believe me as one who has complete information\r\n",
      "on the present state of affairs in all areas’, so that under no circumstances\r\n",
      "could any variation from his masterplan be permitted.^^ He stressed this even\r\n",
      "more with Santa Cruz’s successor, Medina Sidonia. Even in mid-August 1588, a\r\n",
      "week after the Armada had been worsted in battle and driven north into Scottish\r\n",
      "waters, Philip continued to insist that the success of the enterprise depended upon\r\n",
      "following his instructions to the letter. Only in mid-September (as the remnants\r\n",
      "of the storm-tossed fleet approached the Spanish coast) did he relent: ministers\r\n",
      "now drafted orders for Medina Sidonia to land in Scotland, ally with the local\r\n",
      "Catholics and winter there.All this was of course nonsense. Philip did not —\r\n",
      "could not - have ‘complete information on the present state of affairs in all areas’;\r\n",
      "and, even had he somehow managed this feat, most of the information would have\r\n",
      "been seriously out of date by the time he had communicated it to his theatre\r\n",

      "A third and final factor that slowed the pulse of the Spanish Monarchy stemmed\r\n",
      "from Philip’s ‘zero defects mentality’ (p. 42 above). His insistence that ‘it is so\r\n",
      "important that we get everything right’, combined with his desire to take\r\n",
      "all important decisions himself, left no place for error. Before finally authorizing\r\n",
      "any major action the king tried to ensure that everything was in perfect order.\r\n",

      "longest time and prevents voyages, because not having oars or sails ready, or\r\n",
      "having insufficient quantities of ovens to bake biscuits, or the lack of just ten\r\n",

      "Perhaps worse still, once the last oar, sail, oven and mast had been assembled, the\r\n",
      "king expected everything to happen like clockwork. As the duke of Medina\r\n",

      "course, wholly unreasonable given the limitations imposed by sixteenth-century\r\n",
      "information technology.\r\n",
      "It might be argued in his defence that Philip was only an ‘armchair’ strategist\r\n",
      "since he had scarcely ever experienced war at first hand (not at all since 1558), and\r\n",
      "so could not appreciate the truth of the axiom expressed by Helmut von Moltke,\r\n",
      "chief of the Prussian General Staff in the mid-nineteenth century, that ‘no plan\r\n",
      "survives contact with the enemy for more than twenty-four hours’. However,\r\n",
      "many of Philip’s contemporaries displayed greater realism. Thus Elizabeth of\r\n",
      "England and her advisers all shared the king’s practical ignorance of war, but they\r\n",
      "certainly anticipated Moltke’s point. Elizabeth’s Instructions to Howard of\r\n",
      "Effingham for the Armada campaign, for example, seem a model of prudence.\r\n",
      "Having surveyed the various potential threats facing her realm, she concluded on\r\n",
      "a tone very different from — and far more realistic than — Philip’s orders to Medina\r\n",
      "Sidonia:\r\n",
      "Lastly, forasmuch as ther may fall out many accidents that may moove you to\r\n",
      "take another course than by these our instructions you are directed, we therfore\r\n",
      "think it most expedient to refer you therin to your own judgement and\r\n",

      "There is only so much that any human can absorb, digest and act upon in a\r\n",

      "for the work is too heavy for you. You cannot do it all alone.’ True; yet in\r\n",
      "overlooking the significance of this text Philip by no means stood alone. To take\r\n",
      "a striking later example, between 27 June and 3 August 1914, the governments\r\n",
      "in St Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, Paris and London generated between them at\r\n",
      "least 6,000 documents assessing the growing international crisis, a total of well\r\n",
      "over 1.5 million words — far too much to digest and master. Moreover the flow was\r\n",
      "not uniform: the total of incoming messages from ambassadors to each of the five\r\n",
      "foreign ministers rose from an average of four per day at the beginning of the crisis\r\n",
      "to over forty at the end, and the number of messages exchanged directly between\r\n",
      "the various heads of state increased from two per day to over twenty. The pressures\r\n",
      "thus generated overwhelmed the decision-making structures of all the European\r\n",
      "states and thus helped to plunge them into war.^\r\n",
      "However, Philip II’s strategic planning did not suffer simply because he, like\r\n",
      "the statesmen of 1914, accumulated more knowledge than could be assimilated,\r\n",
      "sorted and absorbed in time; the real problem lay in the fact that his system of\r\n",
      "government required all these processes to be carried out by the king in person.\r\n",
      "Like Moses, Philip believed that he alone could mediate divine grace to his people\r\n",
      "and handle all problems adequately. Although he ruled over a Monarchy composed\r\n",
      "of so many different and dispersed territories, each with its own separate\r\n",
      "identity and independent sentiments, he insisted that all the councils and juntas\r\n",
      "at the centre — like the various ministers, institutions and corporations on the\r\n",
      "periphery — should wait to receive their orders from the king in person. Inevitably,\r\n",
      "74 The Context of Strategic Culture\r\n",
      "even without crises, as the business generated by each organ increased, the\r\n",
      "possibility that Philip would be able to play his designated role punctually\r\n",
      "became ever more remote.\r\n",
      "The consequent information overload — disposing of more data than could be\r\n",
      "processed by a single brain - produced three problems for Philip’s Monarchy. At\r\n",
      "the operational level, as already noted, it led to attempts at micromanagement.\r\n",
      "These were clearly doomed to failure because, as John F. Guilmartin has written,\r\n",
      "‘No amount of communications can replace a competent and responsible commander\r\n",
      "on the scene. To attempt to do so is to invite disaster.Philip failed to\r\n",
      "appreciate that ‘complete information on the present state of affairs in all areas’ —\r\n",
      "even had he possessed it — still could not enable him to micromanage a complex\r\n",
      "military operation from his distant headquarters. At the planning level, information\r\n",
      "overload produced two further serious consequences. First, Philip sought\r\n",
      "seclusion at least in part to increase the time available for the undistracted study\r\n",
      "of the information that poured in; yet this sheltered him from the ‘real world’ to\r\n",
      "a dangerous degree. Second, and far more deleterious, since no amount of time or\r\n",
      "effort sufficed to digest the entire corpus of data available, the king evolved certain\r\n",
      "strategies for selecting only those pieces of information that broadly corresponded\r\n",
      "to the plan already adopted.\r\n",
      "The attractions of maintaining harmony between one’s beliefs, actions and\r\n",
      "reactions are obvious; mutual consistency helps every individual to interpret,\r\n",
      "retain and recall information, and it confers continuity on behaviour patterns. Its\r\n",
      "dangers, however, are equally apparent: it can create ‘cognitive rigidity’ in favour\r\n",
      "of information consonant with decisions that have already been taken and against\r\n",
      "any data that challenges them. The very fact that information compatible with the\r\n",
      "existing plan will be used to confirm the choices already taken serves to inhibit the\r\n",
      "development of alternative beliefs. To use a classic case, the conviction that an\r\n",
      "adversary’s military preparations are merely bluff will delay the realization that\r\n",
      "they are ‘for real’, because the two scenarios so closely resemble each other.*”\r\n",
      "Finally, the search for consistency leads to flawed efforts to rationalize all policies\r\n",
      "in terms of the favoured option: instead of seeing that the objective can only be\r\n",
      "attained at the cost of sacrificing some other goals, all considerations are made to\r\n",
      "support the chosen decision — indeed new justifications may be added later in\r\n",
      "order to strengthen the case for the favoured policy and to make it seem the only\r\n",
      "sensible choice.*^\r\n",
      "Of course the evidence available to any statesman during a crisis usually\r\n",
      "permits multiple interpretations — indeed, on occasion, the bulk of the evidence\r\n",
      "may not support the correct explanation — and hunches and experience count for\r\n",
      "much. Rulers who managed to make the right decision have often been just as\r\n",
      "stubborn and biased as their less successful opponents. However, leaders in a state\r\n",
      "of high stress — like Philip in 1587—88 — seem preternaturally disposed to accept\r\n",
      "data that support their preconceived ideas and to avoid anything that contradicts\r\n",
      "them, whether by banishing Cassandras from their courts, by dismissing or\r\n",
      "75\r\n",
      "ignoring dissenting reports, or (worst of all) by distorting all incoming information\r\n",
      "so that it supports their previous assumptions.*^\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, all statesmen need a theoretical structure, a frame of reference of\r\n",
      "some kind, both to know the difference between what is right and what is merely\r\n",
      "opportune, and in order to establish (and maintain) priorities and uphold broad\r\n",
      "policies; otherwise ‘deadlines’ and ‘trying to stop fires’ will not leave time for\r\n",
      "anything else. Part of that frame of reference comes from practical experience -\r\n",
      "from prolonged exposure to the details of operation and of policy. But beliefs,\r\n",
      "values and prejudices also play their part. The imperial vision imparted by his\r\n",
      "father and an almost unshakable conviction that he was engaged in God’s work\r\n",
      "helped Philip to interpret the unprecedented quantities of information at his\r\n",
      "disposal, and to make his decisions. As the king once loftily observed to a\r\n",
      "dispirited subordinate: ‘You are engaged in God’s service and in mine - which is\r\n",
      "the same thing’: throughout his reign, Philip believed profoundly that God would\r\n",
      "provide whatever lay beyond human powers of prediction or execution, and he\r\n",
      "repeatedly counted upon miracles to bridge the gap between intention and\r\n",
      "achievement, to fill the interstices in his strategic plans.*^ Furthermore, his passionate\r\n",
      "faith encouraged the adoption of over-ambitious goals and created a sort\r\n",
      "of ‘messianic imperialism’ that proved to be, at one and the same time, one of the\r\n",

      "than his father had ever got.^^\r\n",
      "Charles s assessment of the secular powers of Italy in 1548 proved a model of\r\n",

      "restored the Medici to power; ever since, Charles noted, the dukes had been ‘very\r\n",
      "solicitous for me and my affairs and he enjoined Philip to maintain good relations\r\n",
      "with them too. Of the other major independent states, Ferrara’s allegiance seemed\r\n",
      "less sure, for although the emperor had likewise intervened to uphold the integrity\r\n",
      "of the duchy, its ruler was related to the French royal family; Mantua had\r\n",

      "political goal lay in preserving the general peace of Italy. The republic of Genoa,\r\n",
      "finally, constituted Spains most important ally in Italy, both because of its\r\n",
      "economic ties with various Habsburg dominions, and because it permitted access\r\n",
      "from Naples, Sicily, Sardinia and Spain to Lombardy, Germany and the Netherlands:\r\n",
      "Philip must therefore do his utmost to preserve and strengthen the ties that\r\n",

      "he could offer to transfer some adjacent Spanish territory to a loyal ally (as he\r\n",
      "dangled the restitution of Piacenza before the duke of Parma and the cession of\r\n",

      "through Spanish eyes — Alexander Farnese, for example, lived at Philip’s Court\r\n",
      "between 1557 and 1566, in England and the Netherlands as well as in Spain. The\r\n",
      "king could also offer a wide range of other rewards: pensions, presents, land, offices\r\n",
      "and honours culminating in a knighthood of the Golden Fleece, the foremost\r\n",
      "order of chivalry in Europe, whose members Philip (grand master of the order)\r\n",
      "called ‘my cousin’.\r\n",
      "All these devices aimed to preserve the ‘pax hispanica’ by peaceful means\r\n",
      "because, in the words of one minister, should the Italian states ‘lose their respect\r\n",
      "for words, it will be hard to regain it with deeds’.The king, therefore, also\r\n",
      "maintained an extensive network of agents and spies throughout the peninsula,\r\n",
      "suborned the servants of other rulers, and even resorted on occasion to assassination\r\n",
      "in order to achieve his ends.^^ In addition, he regularly volunteered his\r\n",
      "services as mediator in territorial disputes between the turbulent rulers of the\r\n",

      "everyone to help preserve ‘the peace of Italy, without permitting changes that\r\n",
      "might threaten its tranquillity’.^^ Thus in 1568—70, he backed Ferrara in a bitter\r\n",
      "dispute with Rome, warning the pope that ‘conserving the peace that Italy enjoys\r\n",
      "today was in everyone’s interests, and that [His] Majesty would not approve of\r\n",
      "anyone starting a war’; while a decade later, when the ambassador of Ferrara\r\n",

      "a proposal to annex by force an area contested with the republic of Lucca, a royal\r\n",
      "minister bluntly repeated that Spain ‘would not suffer anyone to disturb the peace\r\n",
      "of Italy’ and offered binding arbitration instead.When in 1588 Philip’s son-inlaw\r\n",
      "the duke of Savoy invaded and occupied the marquisate of Saluzzo, which by\r\n",
      "law should have reverted to Henry III of France, Philip (taken by surprise) at first\r\n",
      "ordered him to withdraw, in order to avoid jeopardizing the peace of Italy, and\r\n",
      "only gave his approval after hearing that Henry had murdered the duke of Guise,\r\n",
      "leader of the French Catholic League.\r\n",
      "Naturally, like his father before him, Philip did not place his trust in diplomacy\r\n",
      "alone. After all, many Italians longed for the return of an Italy ‘where no\r\n",
      "prince could impose his will on another’, and the king took seriously any sign of\r\n",
      "independence. In particular, the impressive new fortifications constructed by\r\n",
      "various peninsular rulers caused him concern because, should war break out, they\r\n",
      "might successfully resist a siege by Spanish forces. As a military engineer boasted\r\n",
      "to the duke of Mantua, ‘When Your Excellency will have your city completely\r\n",
      "fortified, you will be able to reply to those who ask “Who is your friend’’, “[I am\r\n",
      "the] friend of God and the enemy of everyone else.’’ Against such potential\r\n",
      "threats the Habsburgs constructed state-of-the-art fortifications in their own\r\n",
      "dominions — Sicily, Naples, Sardinia and above all Milan — and maintained a small\r\n",
      "but well-trained standing army in each, as well as squadrons of galleys in their\r\n",
      "main Mediterranean ports. Charles’s ‘Political Testament’ urged Philip not to\r\n",
      "neglect these defences: ‘Even though you will inherit large debts and exhausted\r\n",
      "countries, and will need to look for savings wherever you can, you must not for\r\n",
      "84\r\n",
      "that reason avoid keeping at all times some Spanish garrisons in Italy,’ he warned,\r\n",
      "because they offered the best defence against ‘outbreaks of war and attempts to\r\n",
      "seize territory’. He also extolled the value of the fleets.Once again his son\r\n",
      "hearkened and obeyed, although the cost did indeed plunge Naples and Milan (at\r\n",
      "least) deep into debt: the treasury of the former ran a deficit in every year of\r\n",
      "Philip s reign save one; that of the latter never broke even, despite constant\r\n",
      "subsidies from Spain, Naples and Sicily.On the one hand, the king increased the\r\n",
      "number of galleys maintained by his various Mediterranean states from 55 in\r\n",
      "1562 to 155 in 1574, rendering his naval strength so overwhelming that several\r\n",
      "Italian states (including Genoa, the Papacy and Savoy) virtually demilitarized\r\n",
      "themselves, choosing to disband their own fleet and to rely instead on Philip’s\r\n",
      "galleys for their defence.On the other hand, the king maintained substantial\r\n",
      "forces in the numerous fortresses of the states directly under his rule. By 1572\r\n",
      "seventeen towns in the duchy of Milan, which he and his ministers regarded as\r\n",
      "‘the military core and boundary of all that His Majesty holds in Italy’, boasted\r\n",
      "garrisons; so did a dozen outposts in friendly states beyond the frontiers of the\r\n",
      "duchy. Despite its vulnerability, thanks to these powerful defences Milan served\r\n",
      "as a secure marshalling yard for Philip’s resources in Europe, and its archives\r\n",
      "bristle with transit permits for troops, weapons, armour and specie going to the\r\n",
      "Mediterranean fleet, Germany and above all the Netherlands.^^\r\n",
      "Philip regarded his Italian garrisons as a ‘rapid reaction force’ to deal with any\r\n",
      "threat to his European interests. In 1567, for example, 10,000 Spanish veterans\r\n",
      "previously stationed in Sicily, Naples, Sardinia and Milan marched over the Alps\r\n",
      "to the Netherlands in order to restore order. New recruits from Spain took their\r\n",
      "place. In 1571 these troops, now seasoned and experienced themselves, boarded\r\n",
      "the galleys of both Philip and Venice and featured prominently at the victory of\r\n",
      "Lepanto against the Turks.^^ More controversially, earlier that same year Spanish\r\n",
      "units based in Lombardy also invaded and annexed the marquisate of Finale\r\n",
      "Figure which, though small, possessed great strategic importance: it separated the\r\n",
      "territories of the republic of Genoa; it could offer a Mediterranean port to the\r\n",
      "neighbouring landlocked powers of Mantua, Savoy and Milan; and it might serve\r\n",
      "as a valuable transalpine base for France. In 1566 the subjects of Finale had\r\n",
      "rebelled against their ruler, and two years later the duke of Savoy took advantage\r\n",
      "of the turmoil to annex some disputed villages along his border. Philip allowed\r\n",
      "this to pass, but in 1571 intelligence reports indicated that France stood poised to\r\n",
      "occupy the rest. Acting on direct orders from Madrid, the governor of Milan\r\n",
      "launched a surprise attack and occupied Finale, allegedly to forestall a French\r\n",
      "descent. Lacking the title ‘Imperial Vicar’, however, the king had to back down:\r\n",
      "Emperor Maximilian mobilized almost all the independent states of Italy to\r\n",
      "condemn Philip’s unauthorized initiative, compelling Spanish forces to withdraw.\r\n",
      "^ The king never again used force against an imperial fief. When in 1574\r\n",
      "one of Spain s clients pleaded for armed assistance, the new governor of Milan\r\n",
      "declined: ‘However much power the king may possess,’ he wrote, ‘I cannot\r\n",
      "persuade myself that it is either safe or sound (for us} to take up arms in Italy for\r\n",
      "The Context of Strategic Culture ‘With God on Our Side’ 85\r\n",
      "anybody’. And later that same year, when another minute independent territory\r\n",
      "south of Milan erupted in rebellion against its ruler, Philip allowed the grand\r\n",
      "duke of Tuscany to restore order, even though the Spanish governor of a nearby\r\n",
      "fortress had already intervened with his troops.\r\n",
      "Apart from these minor disturbances, no wars broke out in Italy for fifty years\r\n",
      "after the peace of Cateau-Cambresis in 15 59 - in marked contrast to the preceding\r\n",
      "and succeeding half-centuries. Part of the credit for this belongs to Philip’s pacific\r\n",
      "policies, but equally it derived from the weakness of France. Even though the last\r\n",
      "French garrisons abandoned Italy in 1574, France still constituted the greatest\r\n",
      "potential threat to the Spanish system in the later sixteenth century, just as it had\r\n",
      "in 1548 when Charles wrote his ‘Political Testament’. In that document, the\r\n",
      "emperor claimed that he had always tried to live in peace with the French king,\r\n",
      "and he advised his son to do the same. But, he continued (with an almost audible\r\n",
      "sigh), the French had ‘made many peaces and truces with me, none of which they\r\n",
      "kept — as is well-known — except during the periods when they could not renew\r\n",
      "the war or wanted to wait for an opportunity to harm me clandestinely’. No\r\n",
      "doubt, he mused, they would continue to do so, trying to regain the territories and\r\n",
      "rights he had compelled them to renounce both in the Low Countries and in Italy.\r\n",
      "(But} you must insist that the said renunciations shall remain for ever in being\r\n",
      "and in force, and in no way depart from them, because I captured all of them,\r\n",
      "and you will inherit and possess them, with full rights and evident justification.\r\n",
      "And if you should show weakness in any part of this, it will open the door to\r\n",
      "bringing everything back into question ... It will be better to hold on to\r\n",
      "everything than to let yourself be forced later to defend the rest, and run the\r\n",
      "risk of losing it. If your predecessors with the grace of God held on to Naples\r\n",
      "and Sicily, and also the Low Countries, against the French, you should trust\r\n",
      "that He will assist you to keep what you have inherited.\r\n",
      "Apart from unswerving trust in God, the emperor saw only one practical solution\r\n",
      "to the feud: for Philip to marry a French princess, and to make it a condition of\r\n",
      "the match that France should evacuate the territories of the duke of Savoy,\r\n",
      "occupied since 1536. Admittedly the available Valois princesses were all very\r\n",
      "young but the emperor felt strongly that a way should be found to restore the\r\n",
      "duke of Savoy, who had been his loyal ally, to his inheritance as part of any\r\n",
      "permanent settlement, partly because of the duchy’s strategic situation linking\r\n",

      "take the requisite care of your own security and of (your allies} too’.'^*’\r\n",
      "Once again, the emperor’s words proved prophetic. Although it took another\r\n",
      "decade of war, at the peace of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559 Philip did indeed force\r\n",
      "the French to recognize all his rights and possessions in both the Low Countries\r\n",

      "stern command: he had gained a lasting peace, married his enemy’s daughter and\r\n",
      "secured the restoration of his ally, but he had surrendered nothing.\r\n",

      "strategic position, the king still felt threatened by the military power and the\r\n",
      "undisguised hostility of the French Protestants. As he put it in 1562:\r\n",
      "Neither the service of God, which is the most important service, nor my own\r\n",

      "be certain that all their endeavours will be directed against me and my states.\r\n",
      "Five years later he gloomily observed, the flames are spreading everywhere, so\r\n",
      "that if the [French] monarchy does not make haste to put them out they may be\r\n",
      "consumed by the fire’, and thence they might spread to Spain. He twice sent\r\n",

      "again Charles would have been proud of his son.\r\n",
      "The emperors Political Testament perceived only three areas of special difficulty.\r\n",
      "First, Charles fretted about the manner in which the indigenous population\r\n",
      "of his American colonies had been subjugated by their conquerors: his son must\r\n",
      "strive to find a balance between ‘your royal pre-eminence, and the best interests’\r\n",
      "of the various groups of inhabitants on the other continent.^’ Second, he worried\r\n",
      "even more about the lack of resources to defend his far-flung possessions: all his\r\n",
      "realms had paid heavily for his previous wars and could not be expected to\r\n",
      "continue contributing taxes at the same high levels. This problem was not new -\r\n",
      "Charles s Instructions to Philip in 1543 had warned that ‘Your treasury will be in\r\n",
      "such a state [when you succeed me] that it will give you a lot of trouble’ - but\r\n",
      "matters deteriorated rapidly. When he abdicated, Charles left short-term debts\r\n",
      "of 7 million ducats (almost seven times the annual revenues of Castile) bearing\r\n",
      "interest payments that absorbed all available income.\r\n",
      "Two factors later exacerbated these fiscal problems. On the one hand, Philip’s\r\n",
      "realms enjoyed complete peace for only six months during his entire forty-twoyear\r\n",
      "reign (in 1577), and for much of the time he fought on more than one front\r\n",
      "- against the Turks and the Dutch (1572-77); against the English and Dutch\r\n",
      "(1585-89); against the English and Dutch and in France (1589-98) (see Figure i\r\n",
      "above). On the other hand, the cost of fighting in all theatres constantly increased:\r\n",
      "military expenditure rose dramatically not only because the number of troops,\r\n",
      "warships and fortifications financed by Philip II grew, but also because of general\r\n",
      "price inflation. Looking back in the 1590s, a senior military administrator\r\n",
      "observed:\r\n",
      "If comparison were made between the present cost to His Majesty of the troops\r\n",
      "who serve in his armies and navies, and the cost of those of the Emperor Charles\r\n",
      "V, it will be found that, for an equal number of men, three times as much\r\n",
      "money is necessary today as used to be spent then.\r\n",
      "The military budget accordingly increased prodigiously: defeating the German\r\n",
      "Protestants in 1546—47 required scarcely i million ducats from Spain, but the\r\n",
      "army deployed in the Netherlands against France in 1552-59 absorbed 2 million\r\n",
      "each year, and the Army of Flanders in the 1590s cost almost 3 million annually.\r\n",
      "In 1557 Philip therefore took the dramatic step of suspending all payments from\r\n",
      "his treasury (a measure often called a decree of bankruptcy ) and began to discuss\r\n",
      "rescheduling debt repayments. Three years later, upon finding that the obligations\r\n",
      "of the Castilian treasury totalled 29 million ducats, he did the same again;\r\n",
      "but government borrowing once more began to spiral until in 1574 treasury\r\n",
      "88 The Context of Strategic Culture\r\n",
      "officials in Castile estimated total debts and liabilities at 8i million ducats, a sum\r\n",
      "equivalent to almost fifteen times the total annual revenue. The following year,\r\n",
      "Philip again suspended all payments and began negotiations with his bankers for\r\n",
      "a new rescheduling of his debts. In 1596 he repeated the process a fourth time.\"*^\r\n",
      "Admittedly these ‘decrees of bankruptcy’ affected only Castile - the treasury of\r\n",
      "Naples, for example, continued to make payments throughout the reign, even\r\n",
      "though its debts increased fourfold - but since Castile served as the financial\r\n",
      "motor of the entire Monarchy, its periodic fiscal collapses had serious repercussions\r\n",
      "on the king’s Grand Strategy. Thus in 1559, Philip’s decision to return to\r\n",
      "Spain despite the precarious political situation in northern Europe (see pp. 150—\r\n",
      "I below) stemmed principally from the financial crisis that threatened to engulf\r\n",
      "him: We must all seek the remedy,’ he told his ministers, ‘as I shall do to the\r\n",
      "utmost of my ability. And since it is not here {in the Netherlands} I shall go to\r\n",
      "Spain to seek it.’^° The suspension of payments in 1575 immediately doomed the\r\n",
      "efforts of Philip’s armies to crush the Dutch Revolt, for without the services of\r\n",
      "international bankers\r\n",
      "Even if the king found himself with ten millions in gold and wanted to send it\r\n",
      "all here, he has no way of doing so with this bankruptcy decree, because if the\r\n",
      "money were sent by sea in specie it would be lost, and it is impossible to send\r\n",
      "it by letters of exchange as hitherto because no merchant there {in Spain] can\r\n",
      "issue them, nor can anyone here {in the Low Countries] accept and pay them.\r\n",
      "Within six months the soldiers of the Army of Flanders, starved of their pay, had\r\n",
      "indeed either mutinied or deserted; and within a year the king’s representative\r\n",
      "had been forced to accept a treaty of peace with the rebels.The bankruptcy of\r\n",
      "1596 likewise undermined Spain’s simultaneous attempts to defeat Henry IV of\r\n",
      "France, Elizabeth of England and the Dutch Republic.Credit problems may not\r\n",
      "have forced Philip to sue for peace immediately, and indeed he occasionally\r\n",
      "boasted that he would never compromise simply because of lack of funds;\r\n",
      "nevertheless bankruptcy eventually induced him at least to open talks - in 1558-\r\n",
      "59 with the Turks and French; in 1576-77 with the Turks and Dutch; and in\r\n",
      "I597“98 with the French, English and Dutch.\r\n",
      "A third and last problem perplexed Charles in 1548: the future of the Low\r\n",
      "Countries, his native land. Although he had completely crushed his opponents in\r\n",
      "the region by then, the extreme distaste of the provinces for foreign rule, and the\r\n",
      "evident difficulty of governing them from Spain, nevertheless caused him anxiety.\r\n",
      "He therefore contemplated making Philip’s sister Marfa and her husband,\r\n",
      "Ferdinand’s son Maximilian, joint rulers of the Netherlands. The provinces would\r\n",
      "thus be linked to the Holy Roman Empire, freeing Spain of the need to defend\r\n",
      "them; but he promised Philip that he would not make a final decision ‘until you\r\n",
      "can come here, and see the country for yourself’.’\"*\r\n",
      "The possibility of severing the link between Spain and the Netherlands had\r\n",
      "already been considered in 15445 when Charles promised to marry his daughter\r\n",
      "‘With God on Our Side’ 89\r\n",
      "Maria to Francis I’s younger son, the duke of Orleans, as a means of securing a\r\n",
      "more lasting peace between Habsburg and Valois, with either Lombardy or the\r\n",
      "Low Countries serving as Maria’s dowry. Only the sudden death of Orleans solved\r\n",
      "the dilemma. The ‘devolution plan’ of 1548 also remained a dead letter. Admittedly,\r\n",
      "fifty years later, Philip implemented exactly the same scheme in favour of\r\n",
      "Marfa and Maximilian’s youngest son Albert, who was married to his own\r\n",
      "daughter Isabella, but by then it was too late: major rebellions had rocked the\r\n",
      "Netherlands in 1566 and again in 1572 and 1576, so that by 1598 only ten of the\r\n",
      "seventeen provinces remained under Spanish control.\r\n",
      "The emperor’s hesitation in alienating the Netherlands stemmed mainly from\r\n",
      "strategic considerations. As many of Charles’s councillors had reminded him in\r\n",
      "1544,^ the Low Countries ‘play an essential role in keeping the king of France in\r\n",
      "check ; and, as Charles had insisted earlier in his ‘Political Testament,’ surrendering\r\n",
      "anything to anyone might compromise ‘reputation’; he also feared that ceding\r\n",
      "one possession might well lead to unrest in others.’^ All three arguments resurfaced\r\n",
      "repeatedly during his son’s reign (and after). ‘I am well aware’, Philip wrote\r\n",
      "in 1558, that It IS from the Netherlands that the king of France can best be\r\n",
      "attacked and forced into peace’; in 1582 Philip’s principal adviser on foreign\r\n",
      "affairs repeated that ‘The surest means we have of keeping France in check is to\r\n",
      "maintain strong forces in the Netherlands’; and even after devolving power\r\n",
      "m Albert and Isabella, the Spanish council of State emphasized that the Low\r\n",
      "Countries still served as ‘the bridle with which to check and restrain the power of\r\n",
      "the French, the English and the Dutch, whose forces, should that shield fail,\r\n",
      "would attack Your Majesty and his kingdoms on ail sides, which would produce\r\n",
      "even greater expenses and damage’.”\r\n",
      "Likewise the risk of losing ‘reputation’, whether through failing to make good\r\n",
      "a claim or by making concessions, worried Philip as much as his father. Thus in\r\n",
      "1373 the king decided to continue to fight against the Turks in the Mediterranean\r\n",
      "despite the defection of his principal ally, Venice, because to sue for peace would\r\n",
      "lose the common esteem of the world’. Four years later his ministers advised him\r\n",
      "that negotiations with the Dutch rebels were incompatible ‘with the honour and\r\n",
      "reputation of Your Majesty, which is your greatest asset’: anything but war would\r\n",
      "strain Your Majesty’s conscience and hazard your honour and prestige’.’® Yet\r\n",
      "again in 1588-89 Spain refused to make peace with its northern adversaries in the\r\n",
      "wake of the Armada’s failure: concerning England, one councillor ‘welcomed\r\n",
      "the indications that His Majesty wishes to invade again, because I consider trying\r\n",
      "to recover the reputation and authority that may have been compromised by\r\n",
      "the outcome of the recent enterprise to be of great importance’; concerning the\r\n",
      "Dutch, even though ‘to attempt to conquer the rebellious provinces by force\r\n",
      "IS to speak of a war without end’, the king’s senior advisers saw no alternative\r\n",
      "ecause Christian obligation requires the preservation of one’s reputation\r\n",
      "inviolate’.\r\n",
      "Charles’s argument that weakness in one area would sooner or later compromise\r\n",
      "his son’s hold elsewhere also resurfaced frequently in later years. In 1558, just after\r\n",
      "90\r\n",
      "the death of his wife Mary Tudor, a councillor admonished the king that if he\r\n",
      "failed to retain England, ‘the Low Countries, and in consequence Italy and the\r\n",
      "Americas, would stand in great danger of being lost’; shortly afterwards, with\r\n",
      "England already moving out of the Habsburg orbit, another minister repeated\r\n",
      "that if he lost the Low Countries, Philip’s other possessions - in the Americas and\r\n",
      "the Mediterranean, as well as in the Iberian peninsula - would at once come under\r\n",
      "attack by land and sea.^^’ In 1566, with disorder spreading throughout the\r\n",
      "Netherlands, a minister in Rome warned that ‘All Italy is plainly saying that if the\r\n",
      "rebellion in the Low Countries is allowed to continue, Lombardy and Naples will\r\n",
      "follow’. The council of State in Madrid accepted the argument totally: ‘If the\r\n",
      "Netherlands situation is not remedied’, it warned, ‘it will bring about the loss of\r\n",
      "Spain and all the rest’. Many others - by no means all of them Philip’s officials -\r\n",
      "subscribed to this ‘domino theory’. According to the papal secretary of state in\r\n",
      "1567, ‘If the Netherlands are lost, Spain will enjoy neither peace nor security, so\r\n",
      "that the true and perhaps the only way to secure Spain and also the other states [of\r\n",
      "His Majesty} is to make the supreme and ultimate effort to cure the Netherlands\r\n",
      "[problem} now’. ‘There is a danger that Milan, Naples and Sicily will rebel, seeing\r\n",
      "such a terrible storm in the Netherlands,’ echoed the French ambassador in\r\n",
      "Madrid. A few years later the governor of Milan warned: ‘I greatly fear that the\r\n",
      "Netherlands will in the end be lost, and with that everywhere else will rebel’.^^\r\n",
      "Before long even Philip’s chief financial adviser argued that Spain must fight on\r\n",
      "in both the Mediterranean and the Netherlands, despite the intolerable strain on\r\n",
      "the treasury, ‘in order to restrain and defeat our Muslim and Protestant enemies,\r\n",
      "because it is certain that if we do not defeat them, they are going to defeat us’;\r\n",
      "while the king himself came to fear that ‘If the Low Countries are lost, the rest [of\r\n",
      "the Monarchy} will not last long’.*^^\r\n",
      "When in 1577 Philip’s councillors once more discussed whether to fight in the\r\n",
      "Netherlands or to make concessions in order to secure peace, they again warned\r\n",
      "that clemency would be taken for weakness and would ‘put at risk the obedience\r\n",
      "of other vassals who, it is greatly to be feared, would take it as an example to rebel\r\n",
      "themselves’.Shortly after Philip’s death, the council of State advised his son and\r\n",
      "successor that ‘the security of the rest of Your Majesty’s kingdoms depends in\r\n",
      "large measure upon the conservation of the “obedient provinces’’ [in the Netherlands}\r\n",
      "and the recovery of those that have rebelled’; and that abandoning the Low\r\n",
      "Countries ‘in a way that suggested to the world that we lacked the forces to keep\r\n",
      "them, would cause others to lose respect’, so that the king’s opponents in Italy,\r\n",
      "Portugal, Aragon and even Castile ‘would reveal their evil intentions, which\r\n",
      "perhaps they refrain from showing only through fear of punishment’. Finally in\r\n",

      "Philip II’s Grand Strategy was not entirely predicated on the guidelines laid\r\n",
      "down in his father’s reign, however. To begin with, Italy and the Netherlands\r\n",
      "ceased to form the centre of gravity. Philip’s decision in 1559 to locate his\r\n",
      "The Context of Strategic Culture ‘With God on Our Side’ 91\r\n",
      "headquarters in Spain reflected the fact that the financial, economic and human\r\n",
      "resources of the peninsula, and of its American colonies, had become the mainstay\r\n",
      "of his power; and as time passed his dependence on them increased. Writing only\r\n",
      "a year after the move south, a former Spanish ambassador in England complained\r\n",
      "that ‘Every week it is necessary to remind people [here} that there are other\r\n",
      "kingdoms and states that depend on us, and we on them.’ By 1564, however, the\r\n",
      "perspective of most courtiers had changed. Refuting those who urged the king to\r\n",
      "return to the Netherlands, Secretary of State Gonzalo Perez compared the Spanish\r\n",
      "Monarchy to the human body and asserted: ‘We must all thoroughly understand\r\n",
      "that since [Spain} is the principal member from which we must cure and restore\r\n",
      "all the others, I do not know how His Majesty could leave it.’ Six years later the\r\n",
      "king’s speech to the Cortes of Castile reassured the assembly that ‘His Majesty\r\n",
      "[knows} how necessary and convenient his presence is in these kingdoms not only\r\n",
      "for their own good and advantage, but also to act and provide for [the needs of}\r\n",
      "the other states, since these kingdoms are the centre, the heart and the principal\r\n",
      "part of all his dominions’. Nevertheless, some ministers continued to insist that\r\n",
      "the Monarchy remained a distinct political entity with priorities of its own that\r\n",
      "transcended those of the individual components. Thus in 1573, when a group of\r\n",
      "cardinals pressed Philip either to reside in Italy, to direct the campaign against\r\n",
      "the Turks, or in the Netherlands, to supervise the conduct of the war there, his\r\n",
      "ambassador in Rome (Don Juan de Zuniga) reminded them that\r\n",
      "Since Your Majesty rules so many kingdoms and states, and since in their\r\n",
      "conservation and in the life and well-being of Your Majesty reposes the entire\r\n",
      "welfare of Christendom, it is not enough to believe that the journey should be\r\n",
      "of benefit to the affairs of either Italy or the Netherlands if it is not of benefit\r\n",
      "to the entire global empire which depends on Your Majesty.\r\n",
      "Zuniga had pinpointed a source of tension that affected several early modern\r\n",
      "states formed by the union (often dynastic) of a number of previously independent\r\n",
      "components: although the strategic priorities of the most powerful state eclipsed\r\n",
      "those of other regions, it seldom effaced them. Admittedly ‘sub-imperialism’\r\n",
      "never became as potent under Philip II as during the reign of his son, when\r\n",
      "powerful proconsuls initiated policies that served the interests of the region they\r\n",
      "governed rather than of Castile or of the Monarchy as a whole, but it remained a\r\n",
      "force to be reckoned with. Some powerful viceroys occasionally involved the king\r\n",
      "in a policy that could produce only local benefit (such as the Djerba expedition of\r\n",
      "1560, earnestly desired by the viceroy of Sicily: see pp. 118 and 152 below); rather\r\n",
      "more of them managed to undermine royal initiatives that did not coincide with\r\n",
      "regional interests (thus the governor of Milan resisted Philip’s explicit commands\r\n",
      "to expel all Jews from the duchy for over a year in the 1590s: see p. 277 below).\r\n",
      "The various regents in Brussels proved particularly adept at pursuing a regional\r\n",
      "strategy. Thus between 1569 and 1571 the duke of Alba disagreed fundamentally\r\n",
      "with Philip’s desire to overthrow Elizabeth of England, which ran counter to the\r\n",
      "92\r\n",
      "economic and political interests of the Netherlands, and deployed a remarkable\r\n",
      "array of devices to thwart the king (pp. 157—63 below).\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, although this disharmony between the strategic interests of the\r\n",
      "major components of the Monarchy sometimes undermined effective policymaking,\r\n",
      "Philip’s Grand Strategy increasingly reflected the traditional foreign\r\n",
      "policy goals of Spain. First and most obvious among these lay the absolute\r\n",
      "conviction that the interests of the Iberian peninsula must take precedence over all\r\n",
      "others. As one councillor starkly observed during the Portuguese succession crisis\r\n",
      "of 1578-80: ‘In terms of the utility, the good and the strength of Spain, and of the\r\n",
      "grandeur and power of Your Majesty, uniting the crowns of Portugal and Castile\r\n",
      "matters more than the reconquest of the Netherlands’; and during these years the\r\n",
      "funds sent from Spain to the Low Countries duly plummeted.^^ In 1592, following\r\n",
      "the rebellion of Aragon, another adviser reminded Philip that ‘Spain is the\r\n",
      "centre and the heart of this great Monarchy’, and that any problem in the\r\n",
      "peninsula should be given top priority, ‘because if Spain holds firm, the Indies and\r\n",

      "Second among Spain’s traditional strategic goals came a determination to\r\n",
      "defend the Catholic church against all enemies, both inside and outside Europe.\r\n",
      "This committed Philip - who inherited the title ‘king of Jerusalem’ from\r\n",
      "Ferdinand of Aragon — to ‘use our forces and power against the infidel’, turning\r\n",
      "back the Muslim tide in the Mediterranean and protecting (if not extending) the\r\n",
      "remaining Christian outposts of the East. In 1559, although he made a favourable\r\n",
      "peace with France, Philip bungled negotiations with the Ottoman Turks for a\r\n",
      "truce, and for the next eighteen years he placed the defence of the Mediterranean\r\n",
      "above all other foreign obligations.^^ Even the outbreak of rebellion in the Netherlands\r\n",
      "failed to change this key strategic choice - although the duke of Alba and\r\n",
      "others protested loud and long that peace should be made with the Turks in order\r\n",
      "to concentrate on internal enemies. To the duke, crushing heresy seemed more\r\n",
      "important than defeating the infidel, but the king did not agree. Although his\r\n",
      "agents secured a lasting truce with the sultan in 1578, until the end of his reign\r\n",
      "Philip continued to seek ways to abase the Turks, welcoming imaginative (if\r\n",
      "fruitless) attempts to coordinate operations with other enemies of the Ottomans in\r\n",
      "the Middle East and the Balkans.\r\n",
      "Philip, like his father before him, also opposed Protestantism as strenuously\r\n",
      "and unequivocally as he opposed Islam. In 1566 he reminded the pope of ‘the\r\n",
      "great and numerous obligations and burdens that I bear in the maintenance and\r\n",
      "protection of my kingdoms, in the continuous war that I wage against the infidel,\r\n",
      "and in the defence of Christendom and the public cause of the Catholic religion’.^'\r\n",
      "On several occasions Philip declared himself ready to sacrifice all his dominions,\r\n",
      "if necessary, rather than imperil the integrity of the Catholic faith. ‘Above all\r\n",
      "things I entrust matters of religion to your care,’ he informed his chief minister in\r\n",
      "the Netherlands in 1560, ‘because you can see how necessary it is, and how few\r\n",
      "people in this world watch out for it. And so the few of us who remain must take\r\n",
      "greater care of Christendom, and if necessary we will lose everything in order to\r\n",
      "The Context of Strategic Culture ‘With God on Our Side’ 93\r\n",
      "do what we should in this’. Six years later he assured the pope that ‘rather than\r\n",
      "suffer the least damage to the Catholic church and God’s service I will lose all my\r\n",
      "states, and a hundred lives if I had them’. In 1585 the king’s resolve remained\r\n",
      "unshaken:\r\n",
      "[Although] I hope that Our Lord, in whose service this war [in the Netherlands]\r\n",
      "has been waged and sustained at the cost of so much blood and\r\n",
      "money . . . , will arrange things with His divine providence, either through war\r\n",
      "or negotiation, so that the world will know, by the happy outcome, the fruit of\r\n",
      "trusting in Him, always keeping before us this firm resolve; nevertheless,\r\n",
      "should God be pleased to permit another outcome, for our sins, it would be\r\n",
      "better to spend everything in His cause and service, than for any reason to\r\n",
      "waver.\r\n",
      "In 1590 Philip lamented that the debts he had already incurred for ‘the defence\r\n",
      "of our holy faith and the conservation of my kingdoms and lordships’ would\r\n",
      "increase further with ‘the war with England and the events in France, which I\r\n",
      "could not — and cannot — neglect, because I have such a special obligation to God\r\n",
      "and the world to deal with them; and also because if the heretics prevail (which\r\n",
      "I hope God will not permit) it might open the door to worse damage and danger,\r\n",
      "and we shall have war at home’. A few months later, when a minister made an\r\n",
      "impassioned plea for the king to cut back on his wars in France, the Netherlands\r\n",
      "and the Atlantic, Philip reminded him that ‘These are not matters that can be\r\n",
      "dropped . . . because they involve the cause of religion, which must take precedence\r\n",
      "over everything.\r\n",
      "He felt strongly that other Catholic rulers should show similar firmness.\r\n",
      "Throughout the 1560s he worried that Charles IX of France and his advisers ‘are\r\n",
      "headed for the worst possible destination, which is a deal with their rebellious\r\n",
      "subjects’ and constantly exhorted them to take a firm line against heresy. Philip\r\n",
      "also warned his cousin Maximilian (whose policy of religious moderation as Holy\r\n",
      "Roman Emperor he found alarming) that ‘To believe that a passion as great as the\r\n",
      "one which surrounds the choice of religion . . . can be settled by gentleness and\r\n",
      "concessions, or by other means that avoid firmness and punishment, is to be\r\n",
      "greatly deceived’. According to Philip, the threat (at least) of force should always\r\n",
      "be present.\r\n",
      "Behind these uncompromising assertions that religious principle should always\r\n",
      "prevail over political calculation lay a distinctive political philosophy which\r\n",
      "might be termed ‘messianic imperialism’. At its simplest level, it meant that (as\r\n",
      "the statements above make clear) Philip felt that he possessed a direct mandate to\r\n",
      "uphold the Catholic faith at almost all times and in almost all places. Many of his\r\n",

      "artefacts. Above all, he gathered together at the Escorial no fewer than 7,422\r\n",
      "relics, including 12 entire bodies, 144 complete heads and 306 entire limbs.\r\n",
      "More significant, some authors described Philip’s lifestyle as ‘recogido’, a significant\r\n",
      "term which implied a search for inner sanctity and religious purity; and\r\n",
      "indeed the king sometimes deliberately withdrew from government altogether in\r\n",
      "order to concentrate on his devotions.In Lent, and at times of crisis, he went on\r\n",
      "retreat, and throughout his life he spent a considerable part of each day at prayer.\r\n",
      "As a matter of principle he held up all business while he communed with God —\r\n",
      "whether for an hour or so during a service, or for several days when on retreat — and\r\n",
      "he regularly used this excuse to his ministers for delaying decisions: ‘I could not\r\n",
      "send you any more tonight because today we had a sermon’; ‘I could not see the\r\n",
      "rest (of these papers} yesterday, nor until now today, because of the Mass’; and ‘I\r\n",
      "cannot do anything more tonight, because it is late; nor do I think I can tomorrow\r\n",
      "because it is a day of vespers and matins’.\r\n",
      "No doubt these religious activities, which allowed the king to step back\r\n",
      "temporarily from political concerns and to clear his mind, renewed his strength to\r\n",
      "cope with problems of state. (They also occasionally allowed him to catch up on\r\n",
      "his sleep: in 1584, while at the Escorial during Holy Week, he confessed to his\r\n",
      "daughters that he had just ‘heard two of the longest sermons of my life, although\r\n",
      "I slept through part of them’.) Perhaps his devotions also afforded an opportunity\r\n",
      "for Philip to lay out his options before God and seek guidance, something that\r\n",
      "(like other Spanish statesmen) he may have done with his confessor too.^“ More\r\n",
      "important, however, worship encouraged the king to see politics in religious\r\n",
      "terms, to justify difficult political choices on the grounds that they were necessary\r\n",
      "not only for the interests of Spain but also for the cause of God; to attribute\r\n",
      "victories to divine intervention and favour; and to rationalize defeats and failures\r\n",
      "either as a divine test of Spain s steadfastness and loyalty or as a punishment for\r\n",
      "momentary human presumption.\r\n",
      "Some of these elements of course form the stock-in-trade of many leaders. In the\r\n",
      "twentieth century, Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill and, above all, Adolf\r\n",
      "Hitler all regarded themselves as in some way ‘called’ by Providence, and believed\r\n",
      "their actions in the service of their country to be directed by God.^^ In the early\r\n",
      "modern period, an even stronger element of ‘Providentialism’ underlay the strategic\r\n",
      "thinking of almost all states. Philip’s Protestant enemies also regarded their\r\n",
      "victories as the result of direct divine intervention — a view epitomized by the\r\n",
      "inscription on a Dutch medal struck to celebrate the destruction of the Spanish\r\n",
      "Armada: god blew and they were scattered. They likewise saw their history\r\n",
      "‘With God on Our Side’ 99\r\n",
      "as pre-determined by Providence, and viewed wars against enemies of their faith\r\n",
      "as a crusade — much as Philip II did. One French Protestant warrior, for example,\r\n",
      "hailed the outcome of the Armada campaign in purely biblical terms: ‘The duke\r\n",

      "has put his nose out. God is wonderful in his works, which smash the designs of\r\n",
      "this world just when people are ready to shout “victory”.’ Even Philip’s Muslim\r\n",
      "nemesis, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-66), sought to project the image\r\n",
      "of an eschatological saviour; and as the Islamic Millennium (1591 by Christian\r\n",
      "reckoning) approached, his successors, as well as contemporary Safavid and Mogul\r\n",
      "rulers, saw the world in increasingly apocalyptic terms.But messianic sentiments\r\n",
      "ran particularly strongly in the Iberian peninsula. In the early sixteenth\r\n",
      "century. King Manuel of Portugal (Philip’s grandfather) believed himself destined\r\n",
      "to become emperor of the East, as did his contemporary Ferdinand of Aragon\r\n",
      "(Philip’s great-grandfather); and Charles V clearly thought that his enterprises\r\n",
      "deserved to succeed becausfe they sought to advance the cause of the Catholic\r\n",
      "faith. Some of Philip’s subjects even argued that religion formed the glue that\r\n",
      "held together the entire Monarchy. According to Fray Juan de Salazar, ‘The\r\n",
      "principal reason why Spain has been able to acquire the kingdoms it rules, and the\r\n",
      "fundamental reason of state that it uses to conserve them, is religion’. More than\r\n",
      "all other states, wrote Tommaso Campanella, the Spanish Monarchy ‘is founded\r\n",
      "upon the occult providence of God and not on either prudence or human force’;\r\n",

      "reward. Other soldiers burst into verse to celebrate Spain’s new-found power.\r\n",

      "Ercilla and Fernando de Herrera, whose work circulated widely during the 1580s\r\n",
      "and 1590s — also displayed a self-intoxicating rhetoric which called for Spain to\r\n",
      "conquer the world.\r\n",
      "Such striking consistency in outlook stemmed in part from the common background\r\n",
      "shared by many of the king’s servants. To begin with, over half of the men\r\n",
      "whom Philip appointed to major positions in the central government not only\r\n",
      "held law degrees, but had also attended one of Spain’s six colegios mayores (graduate\r\n",
      "schools) where most of them continued their legal studies: 75 councillors of\r\n",
      "Castile and several of its presidents, 39 councillors of the Indies and all but one of\r\n",

      "‘With God on Our Side’ 103\r\n",
      "Moya de Contreras, archbishop of Mexico, in New Spain). Many secular ministers\r\n",
      "shared the same devout outlook on politics: Don Frances de Alava, for example,\r\n",
      "who served as ambassador in France between 1564 and 1571, protested that if, in\r\n",

      "raises human considerations above divine ones, I hope that God removes me from\r\n",
      "this world ; and his correspondence with Secretary of State Zayas (admittedly a\r\n",
      "priest) exuded religious fervour - one letter cheerily concluded: ‘Spirits up, God\r\n",

      "Such uniformity of belief within the government’s senior cadres, especially\r\n",

      "adherence to established policies, despite mounting evidence that they were not\r\n",
      "working — but even some of the king’s Spanish critics shared the same messianic\r\n",
      "outlook and deployed a similar supernatural panoply to try and change his mind.\r\n",
      "Thus in 1566, as the Protestant tide reached its height in the Netherlands, an\r\n",

      "The holy bones of the Emperor your father are complaining and his spirit will\r\n",
      "demand God s punishment against you if you allow the loss of those provinces,\r\n",
      "without which Spain cannot live in safety. Your Majesty inherited not only\r\n",

      "vision. In 1585 the papal nuncio in Madrid, while sympathizing with the embarrassment\r\n",
      "caused to Philip by Drake’s destructive West India raid, suggested to his\r\n",
      "master that ‘I expect that God will not abandon Spain’s cause’; and in the spring\r\n",

      "When in doubt about the correct policy to follow, Philip consulted committees of\r\n",
      "theologians noted for their apparent ability to interpret the will of God: for\r\n",
      "example, in 1565 he referred the appropriate treatment of heretics condemned by\r\n",
      "the Inquisition in the Netherlands to a Junta de Teologos; and in 1579 he again\r\n",
      "sought the opinion of a number of theologians (some individually, others collectively)\r\n",
      "on whether or not to enforce his claim to the Portuguese throne.Many\r\n",
      "of his subjects consulted prophets. In the 1580s Sor Marfa de la Visitacion (the\r\n",

      "very year the duke of Medina Sidonia asked the ‘nun of Lisbon’ to bless the\r\n",

      "Scotland and Ireland from 1625 until his death on the scaffold in 1649, repeatedly\r\n",
      "adopted a Providential view of public affairs. In 1642, at war with important\r\n",
      "groups of his subjects in all three kingdoms, he declared that his victory would\r\n",
      "show that God had forgiven his sins, whereas defeat would prove that his punishment\r\n",
      "would continue until he had left this world: ‘I have set up my rest upon the\r\n",

      "produce an absence of policy - ‘the forgoing of trust in fleshly reasoning and its\r\n",
      "instruments and institutions’, as a critic wrote of Cromwell — but Philip and his\r\n",

      "correspondence.In 1588, as he struggled to get the Armada to sea, the king\r\n",

      "Rather, Philip’s brand of messianic imperialism led to the error of adopting\r\n",
      "unrealistic policies, doing everything humanly possible to put them into effect\r\n",
      "and then relying on divine intervention to ‘bridge the gap’. Thus in 1571, when\r\n",
      "his plan to support an English Catholic rising began to collapse, Philip convinced\r\n",
      "himself that the invasion formed part of God’s design both for His cause and for\r\n",
      "Spain, and so must go forward anyway.\r\n",

      "letting ourselves be led to undertake enterprises that are either desperate or\r\n",
      "impossible, and with resources that in human terms are inadequate and weak (for\r\n",
      "that would be rather to tempt God than to trust in Him)’.“^ Later, he became less\r\n",
      "cautious. When the marquis of Santa Cruz complained late in 1587 about the\r\n",
      "danger of leading the Armada against England in midwinter, for example, the\r\n",
      "king replied serenely: ‘We are fully aware of the risk that is incurred by sending\r\n",
      "a major fleet in winter through the Channel without a safe harbour, but . . . since\r\n",
      "it is all for His cause, God will send good weather’.\r\n",
      "Naturally, although Santa Cruz remained unconvinced, other ministers at other\r\n",

      "thus make the impossible possible. In 1574, when Philip resurrected the idea of\r\n",
      "invading England at a time when his resources seemed fully committed in both\r\n",
      "the Netherlands and the Mediterranean, his bewildered commander in Brussels\r\n",
      "concluded that such apparent lunacy ‘must be divine inspiration’. In 1588, after\r\n",
      "reviewing the dangers inherent in the king’s Armada strategy, one of the fleet’s\r\n",

      "Truly, sir, I believe we are gradually becoming the target at which the whole\r\n",

      "subjects in the North Netherlands, having somewhat smugly reviewed the various\r\n",
      "defeats and failures of the arch-enemy’ in his diary, likewise began to ‘wonder\r\n",
      "whether the Spaniards might lose in the seventeenth century all the reputation\r\n",
      "that they gained in the sixteenth’.^ Both writers believed that Philip had failed to\r\n",
      "achieve his strategic goals and that, in doing so, he had gravely weakened the\r\n",
      "overall security of the Spanish Monarchy.\r\n",
      "Paul Kennedy s Rise and fall of the Great Powers offered three explanations for\r\n",
      "this failure. To begin with, it accorded great importance to the series of changes\r\n",
      "in the art of war in Europe sometimes termed the ‘Military Revolution’. First\r\n",
      "came the development of more powerful gunpowder weapons in the fifteenth\r\n",
      "century which rendered useless the high thin walls, designed to deter assaults,\r\n",
      "which had for millennia formed the standard defence for human settlements.\r\n",
      "Starting in Italy in the 1520s, however, a new system of fortification appeared,\r\n",
      "with low thick walls built in star-shaped patterns of bastions and ravelins,\r\n",
      "surrounded by a wide moat. Every part of the new defences bristled with guns\r\n",
      "arranged in interlocking fields of fire, ready both to cut down any besiegers rash\r\n",
      "enough to attempt a frontal assault and to keep the enemy’s artillery away from\r\n",
      "the walls. The new style of fortifications, called the ‘modern style’ in Italy and the\r\n",
      "III\r\n",
      "I 12\r\n",
      "‘Italian style’ everywhere else, made it virtually impossible to capture any major\r\n",
      "stronghold quickly. In the Netherlands, Antwerp, surrounded by eight kilometres\r\n",
      "of walls studded with ten bastions, fell in 1585 only after a siege lasting\r\n",
      "a year; while Ostend, a seaport defended by bastions and powerful outlying\r\n",
      "redoubts, withstood investment for three years before it surrendered in 1604.\r\n",
      "Partly in response to the need to mount a sustained blockade of enemy strongholds\r\n",
      "(while at the same time defending one’s own bastioned fortresses), the size\r\n",
      "of armies began to increase rapidly. The armed forces of Habsburg Spain, for\r\n",
      "example, increased almost tenfold in the first half of the sixteenth century.\r\n",
      "Inevitably, this prodigious inflation of manpower, on top of the crippling cost of\r\n",
      "the new fortifications themselves, led to a dramatic leap in expenditure on war.^\r\n",
      "These various developments, according to Paul Kennedy, formed the principal\r\n",
      "reason why the Habsburgs’ bid for mastery failed: thanks to escalating military\r\n",
      "costs they ‘consistently spent two or three times more than the[ir} ordinary\r\n",
      "revenues provided’ on war. Before total victory could be achieved, the state went\r\n",
      "bankrupt.\r\n",
      "Kennedy also suggested that two other problems exacerbated Spain’s military\r\n",
      "and fiscal crisis. On the one hand, he saw the Habsburg empire as ‘one of the\r\n",
      "greatest examples of strategical overstretch in history’: ‘the Habsburgs simply had\r\n",
      "too much to do, too many enemies to fight, too many fronts to defend’ — in the\r\n",
      "Netherlands, Germany, Italy, North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the\r\n",
      "Americas and, after 1580, around the shores of Africa and South Asia as well. In\r\n",
      "the age of the Military Revolution, he argued, no state could hope to fight wars\r\n",
      "on so many fronts and win. On the other hand, Kennedy noted that the\r\n",
      "Habsburgs mobilized even the limited resources available for this herculean effort\r\n",
      "inefficiently. Instead of husbanding every available ducat, time and again they\r\n",
      "squandered resources needlessly: crippling industrial growth with heavy taxes;\r\n",
      "maintaining numerous internal tariff barriers; minting a disastrously overvalued\r\n",
      "copper currency; expelling the Moriscos in 1609; investing huge sums of money\r\n",
      "in palaces and court splendour.^ But is this the whole story?\r\n",
      "Admittedly many contemporaries anticipated Kennedy’s argument. According\r\n",
      "to an English tract, published just after the 1596 bankruptcy decree, Philip’s\r\n",
      "campaigns had become simply too expensive to win.\r\n",
      "[His] warres on land, as those in the Lowe Countries . . . will cost him sixe\r\n",
      "times more than it costeth his enemies, for that before he hath raised a souldier\r\n",
      "in Spaine, and placed him in the frontiers of Artois, ready to fight against a\r\n",
      "Frenchman, it costeth him a hundreth duckets, where a French souldier will\r\n",
      "cost his king but ten.\r\n",
      "Many others excoriated the inefficiency, the backwardness and the underdevelopment\r\n",
      "of the Spanish economy.^\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, the accusation that the Spanish empire mobilized its resources\r\n",

      "the period could reach into all areas or command all subjects within its borders.\r\n",
      "The typical polity of early modern Europe was not the homogeneous and unitary\r\n",
      "nation-state; rather it comprised a loose aggregation of territories formed over the\r\n",
      "course of centuries by marriage treaties, negotiated take-overs and formal mergers.\r\n",
      "In almost every case an act of association laid down in detail the separate identity\r\n",
      "and particular privileges of the various constituent parts. Valois and Bourbon\r\n",
      "France, Stuart Britain and the Spanish Monarchy all formed ‘composite states’\r\n",
      "linked by dynastic rather than by national, geographic, economic or ideological\r\n",
      "ties. Failure to observe the terms of incorporation almost always led - often very\r\n",
      "swiftly - to disaffection and even to revolt, led by the local elite. In addition, each\r\n",
      "major component state retained its own economic, social and (above all) defensive\r\n",
      "interests long after incorporation, and they did not always coincide with those of\r\n",
      "the central government. Thus Charles V favoured war with Denmark in the 1520s\r\n",
      "and 15 30s because its king had come to power by deposing his predecessor,\r\n",
      "married to Charles’s sister, and the emperor felt that dynastic honour required\r\n",
      "him to act. The government of the Netherlands, however, desired peace with\r\n",
      "Denmark because the prosperity of the country’s Baltic commerce (popularly\r\n",
      "known as the ‘mother trade’ because it nourished so many other forms of economic\r\n",
      "activity) depended upon safe passage through the Danish Sound. For similar\r\n",
      "reasons, the Brussels government wanted to preserve peace with England, another\r\n",

      "imperil cordial relations.^\r\n",
      "Conflicting religious allegiances, especially after the rise of the Protestant\r\n",
      "Reformation, also limited government effectiveness in many early modern states.\r\n",

      "minorities - Protestants in the Netherlands, Muslims in Spain - to the\r\n",
      "policies of religious unification that his government sought to impose, and some\r\n",

      "differences. At the private level, it set up a tension between principle and practice\r\n",
      "that caused severe problems. Philip firmly believed - and his many devout\r\n",
      "advisers frequently reminded him - that he served as God’s lieutenant on earth\r\n",
      "and therefore had an obligation to pursue at all times policies consistent with the\r\n",

      "Charles ruled seventeen separate provinces, of which the most powerful were\r\n",
      "Brabant and Flanders in the south and Holland in the north; but whereas these\r\n",
      "three (and a few others) had been administered from Brussels for a century or\r\n",

      "more, others (such as Gelderland) had been acquired only a few years before. The\r\n",
      "absence of an accepted collective name epitomized the political fragmentation of\r\n",
      "the area: documents of the day referred lamely to ‘the Low Countries’ or ‘The\r\n",
      "countries over there’ (Lej pays de par deld, a term coined by the dukes of Burgundy\r\n",
      "who acquired several Netherlands provinces in the fifteenth century, to distinguish\r\n",
      "them from Burgundy itself: Les pays de par degd — ‘the countries over here’).\r\n",
      "The emperor therefore decided to strengthen the ties that bound the seventeen\r\n",
      "Dutch provinces that he ruled. In June 1548 he persuaded the Diet of the\r\n",
      "Holy Roman Empire to recognize them as a single political unit (a ‘Circle’ or\r\n",
      "Reichskreis), to exempt them from imperial jurisdiction and imperial laws (including\r\n",
      "the ‘religious peace’ that permitted all territorial rulers to choose the religious\r\n",
      "creed of their subjects), and to promise to send military assistance if the Netherlands\r\n",
      "were attacked. A year later, having decided to allow his son to inherit the\r\n",
      "Netherlands after all, he persuaded the seventeen provinces - individually and\r\n",
      "collectively - to accept that thenceforth they would all accept the same ruler, and\r\n",
      "to recognize Philip as his heir and successor. Each province, however, retained\r\n",
      "its own representative assembly (the ‘States’), sending representatives when\r\n",
      "requested for meetings of a States-General; but collective decisions of that body\r\n",
      "only became binding when the assembly of each province gave approval. In addition,\r\n",
      "each province had its own laws and legal system, which rarely permitted\r\n",
      "appeals to the central courts, and many boasted a formal contract that detailed the\r\n",
      "‘privileges’ which each ruler had to swear to accept before his authority became\r\n",
      "effective. Any violation of the agreement could (and often did) produce rebellion:\r\n",
      "as one of Philip’s Spanish advisers later noted with alarm, ‘we read in the\r\n",
      "chronicles that there have been thirty-five revolts against the natural prince, and\r\n",
      "after each of them the people remained far more insolent than before’.^\r\n",

      "some isolated rebellions, most notably by Ghent in 1539—40. In the course of\r\n",
      "his reign, however, two further challenges reared their heads. On the one hand,\r\n",
      "Protestant doctrines found many adherents in the area: by 1530 at least thirty\r\n",
      "works by Luther had appeared in Dutch translation, and during Charles’s reign at\r\n",
      "least 2,000 Netherlanders were executed for their religious beliefs and a far larger\r\n",
      "number were sentenced to fines, confiscation or exile. Nevertheless, when the\r\n",
      "emperor abdicated in 1555, partly due to relentless persecution heresy seemed to\r\n",
      "be losing ground. The only major outstanding problem that Philip inherited\r\n",
      "from his father in the Netherlands (as elsewhere) was therefore financial. Despite\r\n",
      "prodigious tax increases, Charles’s expenditure far exceeded revenues and the\r\n",
      "short-term debt of the Brussels government soared from i million ducats in 1544\r\n",
      "to 3.5 million in 1556. The following year Philip convened the States of Brabant\r\n",
      "(the richest province) and asked for new taxes, but they only agreed on condition\r\n",
      "that they themselves would supervise the collection and distribution of the money\r\n",
      "raised. The king bitterly regretted this precedent but, at war with France and the\r\n",
      "The ‘Great Bog of Europe’: the Netherlands, lyyy—jj 117\r\n",
      "Turks, he had no alternative; he also had to make the same concession early in\r\n",
      "1559 in order to secure an even larger grant, the Nine Years’ Aid (worth 3.6\r\n",
      "million ducats), from the States-General.\r\n",
      "Having secured these tax revenues, and having signed the peace of Cateau-\r\n",
      "Cambresis with France, Philip returned to Spain in order to concentrate on the\r\n",
      "affairs of southern Europe. In itself, this need not have proved a crucial error:\r\n",
      "Charles had frequently been absent from the Netherlands, often for years at a time\r\n",
      "(1522—31, 1532-40 and so on), delegating extensive authority to one of his\r\n",
      "relatives as regent. However, Philip foolishly decided to introduce a number of\r\n",
      "innovations to take effect at his departure. He appointed an inexperienced regent,\r\n",
      "his half-sister Margaret of Parma, with extremely restricted powers: he ordered ^\r\n",
      "her to inform him of every matter of note and to take no decision without\r\n",
      "consulting him first; he even provided her with a list of candidates who were to\r\n",
      "be appointed in strict order to ecclesiastical benefices as and when they fell vacant.\r\n",
      "To ensure her compliance, Philip also ordered her to follow in all things the advice\r\n",
      "of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, son of a leading minister of Charles V and an\r\n",
      "experienced diplomat in his own right (he had served as one of Philip’s three\r\n",
      "negotiators at Cateau-Cambresis). Granvelle corresponded directly and regularly\r\n",
      "with the king, often criticizing Margaret. All this seriously undermined her\r\n",
      "authority, and before long the English and French governments withdrew their\r\n",
      "agents from Brussels ‘because we have learned that so far everything is decided in\r\n",
      "Spain’.A second innovation was Philip’s decision to leave behind two tercios of\r\n",
      "Spanish veterans as a permanent garrison, both to guard against the possibility of\r\n",
      "French aggression and to serve as a ‘rapid reaction force’ should a crisis arise in\r\n",
      "north-west Europe. Many Netherlanders regarded their presence with deep suspicion,\r\n",
      "fearing that they might also be used during a domestic crisis. ‘I do not\r\n",
      "believe that people are happy with so many novelties,’ Count Lamoral of Egmont\r\n",
      "(a councillor of State and prominent Netherlands nobleman) advised his colleague\r\n",
      "William of Nassau, prince of Orange. ‘The king is totally determined to retain the\r\n",
      "Spanish infantry and demobilize all the other troops: I leave you to guess his\r\n",
      "reasons.’ Somewhat later Granvelle voiced these fears more clearly: ‘People here\r\n",
      "universally display discontent with any and all Spaniards in these provinces. It\r\n",
      "would seem that this derives from the suspicion that one might wish to subject\r\n",
      "them to Spain and reduce them to the same state as the Italian provinces under the\r\n",
      "Spanish crown.\r\n",
      "The political leaders of the Netherlands soon discovered an effective method of\r\n",
      "registering their hostility. Given the dependence of the Spanish garrisons on local\r\n",
      "taxes for their maintenance, and given the government’s agreement that the\r\n",
      "provincial authorities would control both the collection and the distribution of\r\n",
      "these taxes, the States flatly refused to release any of the Nine Years’ Aid until the\r\n",
      "Spaniards left. After much heart-searching the king crumbled and, early in 1561,\r\n",
      "the troops sailed home — despite Granvelle’s warning that ‘they serve as a brake on\r\n",
      "people here: please God, let no trouble start once they have gone’.^^ Events soon\r\n",
      "justified his fears. In 1559 Philip had secretly arranged with the pope to create a\r\n",
      "new episcopal hierarchy for the Netherlands, where only four bishops ministered\r\n",
      "to over three million people; under the ‘new bishoprics scheme’, fourteen more\r\n",
      "sees (including one archbishopric) would be added. In addition, two members of\r\n",
      "each new diocesan chapter would serve as inquisitors to crack down on heresy,\r\n",
      "thus supplementing the efforts of the undermanned and overworked apostolic\r\n",
      "inquisition in the area. The new bishoprics scheme remained a closely guarded\r\n",
      "secret for two years while a committee appointed jointly by the pope and the king\r\n",
      "worked out the new diocesan boundaries. By 1561 everything seemed ready and\r\n",
      "so, without warning, the pope published the scheme and named the new bishops\r\n",
      "(all of them proposed by Philip). Granvelle became both primate of the new\r\n",
      "hierarchy and a cardinal.\r\n",
      "A huge outcry immediately broke out in the Netherlands. The political elite\r\n",
      "felt alienated by the secrecy with which the scheme had been devised; many senior\r\n",
      "clerics opposed the plan because finance for the new bishops would come from\r\n",
      "redistributing the revenues from existing ecclesiastical institutions (theirs!); and\r\n",
      "the towns, led by the cosmopolitan trading metropolis of Antwerp, objected\r\n",
      "vociferously to the expansion of the Inquisition on the grounds that it would\r\n",
      "damage their trade with Protestant countries. Philip thus achieved a feat that had\r\n",
      "escaped his father: previously the nobles, the clergy and the towns of each province\r\n",
      "had always been at each other s throats; the new bishoprics scheme now united\r\n",
      "them. This time the Netherlands elite exploited the factions at the king’s Court.\r\n",
      "In the opinion of a French observer, ‘The stubbornness of the [Netherlands] nobles\r\n",
      "in their quarrel rests upon the favouritism and divisions that exist at the Court of\r\n",
      "Spain . . . The duke of Alba and Ruy Gomez . . . spread their wings to the most\r\n",
      "distant lands such as the Netherlands, where the duke supports Cardinal\r\n",
      "Granvelle, and Ruy Gomez, who has been [the cardinal’s] enemy since the days of\r\n",
      "the late emperor, favours his opponents’.Granvelle’s opponents in Brussels made\r\n",
      "full use of their contacts at Court — above all Ruy Gomez and Francisco de Erasso\r\n",
      "- to discredit him and to assure the king that, at the price of a few small\r\n",
      "concessions, all would again be well in the Netherlands. In the face of\r\n",
      "their tenacious and well-orchestrated opposition Philip crumbled yet again: first\r\n",
      "he abrogated the inquisition idea; then he suspended the appointments to\r\n",
      "several new sees (including Antwerp); finally he agreed to recall Granvelle whom\r\n",
      "everyone (wrongly) suspected of masterminding the unpopular scheme.\r\n",
      "In retrospect, this sequence of retreats clearly formed the prelude to the major\r\n",
      "rebellion in the Netherlands that began in 1566; why did Philip not realize the\r\n",
      "danger at the time and take a firmer stand? The principal explanation lies in the\r\n",
      "king’s perceived need to accommodate his principles - no compromise on heresy,\r\n",
      "no concessions to opponents, loyalty to his subordinates - to a series of crises\r\n",
      "outside the Netherlands. In the summer of 1560 the Ottoman fleet ambushed a\r\n",

      "in North Africa, capturing some thirty galleys and 6,000 veteran troops. Withdrawing\r\n",

      "concentrated on destroying the new bishoprics scheme and securing the recall of\r\n",
      "Granvelle, Philip focused all his resources and attention first on sending an\r\n",

      "to take Malta, forcing Philip to concentrate on making plans for its relief The\r\n",

      "her mother, Catherine de Medici queen regent of France, with selected ministers\r\n",
      "from each side in attendance, in order to resolve outstanding differences between\r\n",

      "attended in person) resolved to return to the Netherlands, preceded by a powerful\r\n",
      "army. Since the loyalty of all the coastal provinces of the Netherlands seemed\r\n",
      "suspect, the troops would have to travel from Spain to Milan, and thence across\r\n",
      "the Alps and overland; once they had ended the troubles, Philip would sail from\r\n",

      "his invitation to serve as commander. So on 29 November Philip appointed the\r\n",

      "another year, but Alba left Spain in April 1567 and led his force of 10,000 Spanish\r\n",

      "that this would cause the loss of areas that would prove extremely difficult\r\n",
      "and expensive to recover later, and they delayed carrying out Alba’s orders for as\r\n",
      "long as they could; but the duke insisted.^'’\r\n",
      "His gamble began to pay off in late July when Spanish troops ambushed and\r\n",

      "accelerate the process of pacification. At first the policy proved spectacularly\r\n",
      "successful. Mechelen, which had refused to accept a royal garrison in June and\r\n",
      "had then welcomed the prince of Orange’s troops in August, was taken by storm\r\n",

      "against Zutphen, the strongest town in the area, which (like Mechelen) had not\r\n",
      "only refused to accept a royalist garrison but then promptly defected to the rebels.\r\n",
      "Once again, ‘beastliness’ paid off: after the brutal sack of the city. Alba proudly\r\n",

      "capture of Zutphen and the terror that it caused’.The rebel centres in Friesland,\r\n",

      "approached their town. The entire revolt might therefore collapse, if only the\r\n",
      "Spaniards could persevere for a few more weeks.^^ Second, Alba worried that if the\r\n",

      "operations in Holland and Zealand had been severely hampered by the lack of\r\n",
      "warships and munitions: the Sea Beggars captured the naval Arsenal at Veere -\r\n",
      "full of bronze and iron guns, powder and shot - in April 1572; fourteen ships just\r\n",

      "that seemed ready to declare for them. Count Bossu, for one, realized that the\r\n",
      "royalists faced two distinct naval problems: they needed more warships to defend\r\n",
      "all possible targets in the threatened provinces; and to support these ships, they\r\n",
      "needed to control one or more suitable harbour? where the vessels could shelter,\r\n",
      "refit and take on new provisions. In this respect, the loss of most major ports in\r\n",
      "Holland and Zealand proved critical because those two provinces possessed the\r\n",
      "only suitable deep-water facilities in the entire Netherlands: those of Flanders and\r\n",
      "Brabant either lay too far from the sea or held too little water to serve as adequate\r\n",
      "naval bases. ‘If we do not recover Holland soon’, Bossu grimly (and accurately)\r\n",
      "warned, ‘we shall be hunted from the sea’.^° Furthermore, although the small royal\r\n",
      "fleet in the Low Countries managed to score some successes in the early months of\r\n",
      "The Formation of Grand Strategy 139\r\n",
      "the war, each engagement with the rebels caused losses that could not be replaced\r\n",
      "and damage that could not be made good. Eventually not enough fighting ships\r\n",
      "remained to secure victory: one royal squadron met with defeat on the Zuider Zee\r\n",
      "in October 1573 and two more in the attempts to relieve Middelburg in January\r\n",
      "and February 1574. A further unsuccessful engagement in the Scheldt estuary the\r\n",
      "following May more or less eliminated the king’s navy in the Netherlands.\r\n",
      "Now the king could only wrest command of the sea from the Dutch by the\r\n",
      "dispatch of a powerful naval squadron from Spain. Philip had long appreciated the\r\n",
      "value of a navy to defend his southern possessions: in the Mediterranean, thanks\r\n",
      "to a massive programme of construction, he managed to triple the size of his fleet\r\n",
      "from 55 to 155 galleys. At the same time, he issued a stream of orders designed\r\n",
      "to increase the quantity and improve the quality of ships laid down in the yards\r\n",
      "of Cantabria, whether for service northwards to Flanders, or westwards to\r\n",
      "America. But until the 1580s this shipbuilding programme did not include the\r\n",
      "construction of warships capable of operating effectively in the North Sea.®^\r\n",
      "Accordingly, when Alba began to plead for the dispatch of fighting ships from\r\n",
      "Spain in order to defeat the rebels, he and the king thought at first in terms of\r\n",
      "galleys. However, an itinerary for the galleys to sail to Flanders prepared by the\r\n",
      "chief pilot of Spain turned out to be impractical: the shortest route was almost\r\n",
      "1,000 kilometres, and the safest 1,300. Philip warned Alba to expect little help\r\n",
      "from this quarter.^^\r\n",
      "Instead, the king began to plan the dispatch of Spanish sailing warships to\r\n",
      "regain command of the North Sea. Since he lacked a High Seas fleet, the necessary\r\n",
      "vessels would have to be commandeered from the merchant marine and supplied\r\n",
      "with ordnance, munitions and soldiers by the crown. This technique had worked\r\n",
      "well enough in 1565-66, when the king commissioned his most experienced\r\n",
      "Atlantic commander, Pedro Menendez de Aviles, to destroy all French bases in\r\n",
      "Florida and reassert Spanish control in the western Atlantic; but whereas twentyfive\r\n",
      "ships had sufficed to recover Florida, such a small force would make little\r\n",
      "impression on the Dutch.®\"^ So in February 1574 the king signed orders to create\r\n",
      "a fleet based on Santander both to clear ‘the Channel Cof pirates} and to recapture\r\n",
      "some ports in the Netherlands occupied by the rebels’; he also ordered the\r\n",
      "embargo of 224 ships in the ports of Spain, from which Menendez would choose\r\n",
      "his task force, and the recruiting of 11,000 soldiers.\r\n",
      "Naturally this represented an impossible goal for a single campaigning season\r\n",
      "and provides another example of Philip’s lack of strategic sense. To locate and load\r\n",
      "the artillery and other equipment required to turn a merchantman into a fighting\r\n",
      "ship took months and, for such a huge undertaking (as Menendez and several of\r\n",
      "Philip’s councillors pointed out), ‘it could take years’. Moreover, once in northern\r\n",
      "waters, such a large fleet would need a safe harbour in which to shelter in case of\r\n",
      "need, and Philip no longer controlled one.^*^ Gradually Menendez came to realize\r\n",
      "this and in August suggested to the king that instead of going to the Netherlands\r\n",
      "he should merely cruise between Brittany and the Scilly isles, capturing and\r\n",
      "punishing all the ‘pirates’ he encountered; if storms threatened, the fleet could\r\n",

      "take refuge either in the Scillies or in some Irish port, and from that base a\r\n",
      "squadron could be sent directly to the Netherlands the following spring. The king\r\n",
      "immediately agreed to this ingenious plan — in effect a blockade of the Channel\r\n",
      "approaches — but he did not do so solely because the fleet as yet lacked the strength\r\n",
      "to gain control of the North Sea.^^ Earlier in the summer the Turks had sent a\r\n",
      "large fleet west which laid siege to the Spanish garrisons at La Goletta and Tunis;\r\n",
      "Philip knew that, should they fall, the defence of the Mediterranean might\r\n",
      "become more urgent than the recovery of Holland and Zealand. He therefore\r\n",
      "ordered the fleet to stay close to Spain in case it might be needed to keep the Turks\r\n",
      "at bay. In the end it made no difference because, even as he led his fleet out of\r\n",
      "Santander to patrol the Channel in September, an epidemic carried off Menendez\r\n",
      "and many of his men. The king cancelled the entire expedition.He had squandered\r\n",
      "over 500,000 ducats on it.^^\r\n",
      "This fiasco, coupled with the simultaneous loss of Tunis and La Goletta along\r\n",
      "with all their defenders and the failure of the siege of Leiden, led the king and his\r\n",
      "advisers to consider yet another alternative strategy: a negotiated settlement with\r\n",
      "the Dutch. Initially Philip had taken a hard line in the Netherlands for two\r\n",
      "reasons: ‘for the conservation of religion, and to preserve the obedience of the\r\n",
      "[king’s} vassals there in light of the example of France, where the rebels were\r\n",
      "treated with so much circumspection, pardoning them and even honouring\r\n",
      "them’.^'^ The duke of Alba, at least, had no intention of making this mistake. ‘Let\r\n",
      "this rebel [Orange} lay down his arms and beg for mercy, and then we can\r\n",
      "see what should be done,’ he advised the king on one occasion; and on another:\r\n",
      "‘These troubles must be ended by force of arms, without any use of pardon,\r\n",
      "mildness, negotiations or talks: that will be the right time for clemency’.^^ As the\r\n",
      "situation deteriorated, however, the king wavered in his resolve. His decision in\r\n",
      "1573 to recall Alba stemmed primarily from his conviction that force must\r\n",
      "henceforth be tempered by concessions in order to save the Netherlands\r\n",
      "for God and its sovereign, and in July of that year he tried to implement a more\r\n",
      "conciliatory policy even while the duke remained in charge. With his forces fully\r\n",
      "committed in the Mediterranean, the king told Alba that ending the war in the\r\n",
      "Netherlands as soon as possible and on almost any terms had now become his\r\n",
      "highest priority:\r\n",
      "[Although I rejoice at all your victories} it is essential that we bring aflfairs to\r\n",
      "a conclusion, as much to avoid the loss and destruction of those provinces as\r\n",
      "because of the impossible situation we face for money. So I request and require\r\n",
      "you most earnestly to arrange things so that we may gain days, hours and even\r\n",
      "moments in what must be done to secure [a peace}.\r\n",
      "Yet again, this insistence on an immediate change of policy 1,000 kilometres\r\n",
      "away proved totally unrealistic. The courier carrying this crucial dispatch only\r\n",
      "arrived in the Netherlands six weeks later — long after the fall of Haarlem, which\r\n",
      "would have afforded an admirable opportunity for clemency — and by then the\r\n",
      "Spanish army had begun to besiege Alkmaar. Its commander still failed to see the\r\n",
      "need for compromise; indeed he felt that he had been far too lenient in the past.\r\n",
      "‘If Alkmaar is taken by force, I am determined not to leave a human being alive,\r\n",
      "but rather to slit all their throats. Since the example of Haarlem, where all the\r\n",
      "burgers (except for forty or so) were pardoned, has not brought any benefit,’ he\r\n",
      "told the king, ‘perhaps an example of cruelty will bring in the rest of the towns\r\n",
      "[in revolt}’. Warming to his theme. Alba continued: ‘I cannot refrain from\r\n",
      "beseeching Your Majesty to disabuse yourself of the notion that anything will ever\r\n",
      "be accomplished in these provinces by the use of clemency. Things have reached\r\n",
      "the point where many Netherlanders who until now have been begging for\r\n",
      "clemency now admit their mistake and believe that every living soul in Alkmaar\r\n",
      "should have their throats cut.’^^\r\n",
      "The duke’s forceful statements highlighted the fact that the king’s policies once\r\n",
      "again stood at variance with his principles. Under pressure from Ruy Gomez and\r\n",
      "the moderates, Philip had been on the point of issuing a ‘General Pardon’ for his\r\n",
      "rebels (albeit with numerous exceptions), but upon reading Alba’s objections to\r\n",
      "clemency (which arrived after Ruy Gomez’s death) he decided to hold it back for\r\n",
      "a while. He nevertheless remained perplexed by the confusing advice received\r\n",
      "from the various factions at his Court and in the Netherlands. In one of the\r\n",
      "tortuous holograph letters in which he sought to persuade Requesens to take over\r\n",
      "from Alba, the king summarized the arguments he had heard. On one side stood\r\n",
      "the duke and his supporters, who saw the revolt as primarily religious and\r\n",
      "therefore impossible to end by compromise, since the king’s conscience could not\r\n",
      "allow him to grant toleration. On the other side were the loyal Netherlanders and\r\n",
      "their supporters at Court who ‘say that very few acted for reasons of religion, but\r\n",
      "rather through the ill treatment they have received in everything . . . and that the\r\n",
      "panacea is mildness, good treatment and a general pardon’. But who was right?\r\n",
      "The king confessed that:\r\n",
      "With so many different opinions I have found myself in a quandary, and since\r\n",
      "I do not know the truth of what is happening there I do not know which\r\n",
      "remedy is appropriate or whom to believe; so it seems to me safest to believe\r\n",
      "neither the one group nor the other, because I think they have [both} gone to\r\n",
      "extremes. I believe it would be best to take the middle ground, although with\r\n",
      "complete dissimulation.\r\n",
      "To cover all eventualities the king decided to prepare two contradictory Instructions\r\n",
      "for Requesens: ‘those in Spanish seem to lean somewhat in one direction,\r\n",
      "while those in French very clearly go in the other’. He apologized for the\r\n",
      "difficulties this might cause, but concluded: ‘I did not want to burst my brains\r\n",
      "emending them except for small things because your real instructions will be\r\n",
      "what you see and understand when you get there’. He did, however, expressly\r\n",

      "South Holland exchanged letters merely about ransoms and the future treatment\r\n",

      "The religious upheavals of the sixteenth century transformed international relations\r\n",

      "of almost every state, a nucleus of zealots prepared to place the advancement of\r\n",
      "their religion above obedience to their rulers. Elizabeth I of England survived over\r\n",

      "and Henry of Guise in 1563, Gaspard de Coligny and many other Protestant\r\n",
      "chiefs in 1572). Second, the growing ideological differences seriously complicated\r\n",
      "- in the sixteenth century as in the twentieth — regular diplomatic intercourse\r\n",
      "between parties divided by strongly held beliefs: Elizabeth expelled two\r\n",
      "Spanish ambassadors for supporting plots against her life hatched by Catholic\r\n",

      "Philip refused to allow him to conduct Protestant worship in his own embassy.\r\n",
      "Finally, the Reformation disrupted the established pattern of international alliances.\r\n",
      "In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries Castile and the Netherlands\r\n",
      "had been the traditional allies of England, while France sided with Scotland, but\r\n",
      "the breach with Rome first by England and then by Scotland effected a diplomatic\r\n",
      "revolution. As Lord Bprghley, Elizabeth’s chief minister, observed in 1589: ‘The\r\n",
      "state of the world is marvellously changed, when we true Englishmen have cause\r\n",
      "for our own quietness to wish good success to a king of France and a king of\r\n",
      "Scots.\r\n",
      "This critical transition began in 1553—54 with the successful negotiations of\r\n",
      "Charles V to marry his son and heir, Philip, to Queen Mary Tudor of England.\r\n",
      "This diplomatic and dynastic coup not only created a powerful new Habsburg\r\n",

      "England and the Netherlands to the north; Franche-Comte and the empire to the\r\n",

      "out of hand ‘on account of her birth and for religious considerations’, the\r\n",
      "king — resident in Brussels at this time — decided to test the waters, albeit with\r\n",
      "remarkably little enthusiasm. In January 1559, ‘feeling like a condemned man\r\n",
      "wondering what is to become of him’, he authorized his trusted ambassador in\r\n",
      "London, the count of Feria, to respond positively to Elizabeth — but only ‘to serve\r\n",

      "religion that she has in mind’ (and only if the terms were better than those agreed\r\n",
      "when he married Mary Tudor). ‘Believe me,’ he later confided Feria, ‘if it were not\r\n",
      "for God’s sake, I would never do this. Nothing could or would make me do this\r\n",
      "except the clear knowledge that it might gain the kingdom [of England] for His\r\n",
      "service and faith’. After a few weeks, however, Elizabeth rejected her graceless\r\n",

      "Protestant again.^\r\n",
      "Philip now faced an awkward dilemma. Eight years of almost continuous war\r\n",
      "with France and the Turks, fought on several fronts with armies and navies of\r\n",
      "unprecedented size, had exhausted the Spanish Monarchy and the king had\r\n",
      "already been forced to reschedule his debts (p. 87 above). Under these circumstances\r\n",
      "a major new military undertaking such as an invasion of England to\r\n",
      "restore Catholicism, especially while the war with France continued, remained\r\n",
      "inadvisable. And yet, unless he acted swiftly, Elizabeth’s new religious settlement\r\n",
      "might become entrenched and far more difficult to destroy at a later date. In a\r\n",
      "confidential holograph letter to Feria in March 1559 the king gave vent to his\r\n",
      "frustration:\r\n",
      "This is certainly the most difficult decision I have ever faced in my whole\r\n",
      "life . . . and it grieves me to see what is happening over there [in England] and\r\n",

      "seem far milder than such a great evil deserves . . . But at the moment I lack the\r\n",
      "resources to do anything.\r\n",

      "the Protestant Elizabeth). Even after the peace of Cateau-Cambresis ended the war between\r\n",
      "Scotland, France and England in April 1559 the couple retained all their titles and placed them\r\n",
      "on their seal: Francis and Mary, by the grace of God rulers of France, Scotland, England and\r\n",
      "Ireland.\r\n",
      "Three events saved her from this fate. In June a group of Scottish Protestants\r\n",

      "Ireland’ (see Plate 22) and prepared to send an expeditionary force to restore order\r\n",

      "sudden change of regime in France in order to invade England; so did the pope,\r\n",
      "who even promised to invest Philip as king of England, so that his conquest would\r\n",
      "be legal.^ But Philip declined. As late as 23 June 1559 he declared his intention\r\n",
      "of staying in the north ‘at least until next January’, sending a long paper of\r\n",
      "explanation to his sister Juana, regent in Spain; and he urgently requested funds\r\n",
      "both for his proposed intervention in England and for his continued residence in\r\n",
      "the Netherlands ‘because without it everything here will be lost, and my person\r\n",
      "too’. He demanded a response ‘by a special courier who will come for no other\r\n",
      "purpose’. The reply, when it eventually arrived, delivered a slap to the royal face:\r\n",
      "Juana flatly refused to send any money at all and her advisers found his requests\r\n",
      "so unrealistic that (as Philip noted ruefully) ‘they had a good laugh’ at his\r\n",
      "expense. The councillors had good cause: the Castilian treasury lay empty, many\r\n",
      "areas in the crown of Aragon verged on open insurrection, and Protestant cells had\r\n",
      "been discovered in Seville and Valladolid (the administrative capital). Above all,\r\n",
      "attempts to conclude a peace with the Turks had failed, raising fears of new\r\n",
      "attacks in the western Mediterranean. Spain urgently required her king to return\r\n",
      "and take personal control; under the circumstances, Philip’s request for more\r\n",
      "money specifically to prolong his absence seemed ridiculous. On the other hand\r\n",
      "his Netherlands advisers continued to urge that he stay for at least a few months\r\n",
      "more in the north since his departure might precipitate ‘developments that could\r\n",
      "do irreparable damage to His Majesty and his successors. It cannot be a good thing\r\n",
      "for him to leave the Netherlands with English affairs as they are at present and\r\n",
      "relations with France not settled. I am not sure that the needs of Spain are so great\r\n",
      "that they exceed ours.’ In the end, it all came down to money. On 24 June, the\r\n",
      "day after his urgent letter to Spain, a special financial commission convened by the\r\n",
      "king in Brussels advised him to expect no more money from the Netherlands:\r\n",
      "instead they argued that funding from abroad - that is, from Spain - would be\r\n",
      "essential to put his policies for northern Europe into effect. This seems to have\r\n",
      "made up Philip’s mind: later that week he announced his intention to return to\r\n",
      "Spain, and in July he left Brussels for the coast. Even news of Henry IPs death\r\n",
      "failed to produce a change of heart: he set sail for the land of his birth in August\r\n",
      "11\r\n",
      "1559-\r\n",
      "One cannot really blame Philip for this decision: he had little choice. He could\r\n",
      "no longer govern Spain and intervene effectively in the Mediterranean from\r\n",
      "Brussels, over i ,000 kilometres away; he lacked the money to do anything useful\r\n",
      "in the north; and, as Juana pointed out, the time had come to address directly the\r\n",
      "problems created in his southern kingdoms by the relentless demands of war and\r\n",
      "by his five-year absence. Philip’s error lay in believing that he could intervene\r\n",
      "effectively in the affairs of Britain (or the Netherlands) from Spain: thanks to his\r\n",
      "first-hand experience as king of England, Philip came to regard himself as an\r\n",
      "expert on the subject. He could not understand, for example, why in 1570 the\r\n",
      "pope decided to excommunicate Elizabeth without consulting him first, knowing\r\n",
      "that I could give him better information and advice on that kingdom and on its\r\n",
      "affairs and people than anyone else’.^^\r\n",
      "The same confidence that he possessed an unrivalled comprehension of British\r\n",

      "source of potential tension within the Habsburg Monarchy. Alba, for example,\r\n",
      "possessed very firm views on the ‘British question’. He too had spent some time\r\n",
      "in England during which, like his master, he had noted both the complexity of\r\n",

      "would remain neutral. He therefore opposed any attempt to undermine or\r\n",
      "dethrone the queen. Until he left Spain in 1567, any difference of opinion between\r\n",
      "the duke and his master had limited significance, because before taking a decision\r\n",

      "also the means to thwart the execution of any ‘interventionist’ initiatives with\r\n",
      "which he disagreed.\r\n",
      "Inertia rather than policy decided the outcome of the first ‘British crisis’ of the\r\n",
      "reign, however. No sooner had Philip left the Netherlands than both England and\r\n",
      "France took major steps to secure a favourable solution to the Scottish problem.\r\n",
      "The French sent an expeditionary force to support Mary of Guise: it soon regained\r\n",
      "Edinburgh and drove the Protestants back beyond the Forth. Elizabeth retaliated\r\n",
      "by mobilizing a huge fleet — the largest until 1588 — which sailed to Scotland and\r\n",

      "adviser in the Netherlands, it seemed clear that to secure England ‘we should do\r\n",
      "the same as we would to secure Brussels’, but Philip remained unmoved: instead\r\n",
      "he concentrated on a combined operation against the North African island of\r\n",
      "Djerba. Luckily for him (and Elizabeth) storms dispersed a second French expeditionary\r\n",

      "brother-in-law Philip for assistance. ‘Since we agree that this is all about religion’,\r\n",
      "the French king asked that Philip should warn Elizabeth ‘that if she did not\r\n",

      "her, that he {Philip} would embrace God’s cause and assist and favour the king his\r\n",
      "brother [Francis II} with all his strength and means’.The appeal came too late:\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had already sent an envoy to ask Philip for assistance should her realm\r\n",
      "be attacked by the French, and in March 1560 the king agreed. ‘Given the\r\n",
      "153\r\n",
      "importance to us, and the danger that would follow to our dominions if she and\r\n",
      "her kingdom were lost’, Philip ordered his Spanish veterans in the Netherlands to\r\n",
      "stand ready to help Elizabeth in case of French attack. This sealed the fate of the\r\n",
      "French — and of the Catholic faith — in Scotland. Far from home, blockaded at\r\n",
      "Leith by the Scots on land and by England’s navy at sea, in July Francis’s 4,000\r\n",
      "troops capitulated. A representative assembly quickly gathered in Edinburgh and\r\n",
      "introduced a Reformed church order.Elizabeth had established her independence\r\n",
      "with little help from Philip (her enthusiasm for a Habsburg marriage cooled\r\n",
      "rapidly), and two subsequent events soon reinforced it. In December 1560 the\r\n",
      "death of Francis II left the French throne to his ten-year-old brother Charles IX\r\n",
      "and thus temporarily removed the threat of further French intervention across\r\n",
      "the Channel, and the next month all Spanish troops in the Netherlands sailed\r\n",
      "home in order to take the place of the veterans lost in the ill-fated Djerba\r\n",
      "expedition.\r\n",
      "Thanks to his decision to concentrate on Spain and the Mediterranean, Philip\r\n",
      "had lost his first and best chance to tame Tudor England and for the next few\r\n",
      "years, although Elizabeth remained vulnerable, the king neglected English (as\r\n",
      "well as Netherlands) affairs while he fought the Turks. A letter to his ambassador\r\n",
      "in London in 1562 typified the prevailing attitude. After acknowledging receipt\r\n",
      "of numerous dispatches, and asking for the flow of information to continue, he\r\n",
      "announced:\r\n",
      "If your letters have not been answered and the present does not deal with them\r\n",

      "dependent on him would be to make things harder for her - for example by\r\n",
      "covertly supporting her Catholic opponents in England and Ireland. Instead he\r\n",
      "did everything possible to protect her. In 1562, the leaders of the French Protestants\r\n",
      "(normally known as Huguenots) attempted to seize control of the person of\r\n",
      "Charles IX and, having failed, began an armed struggle to secure religious and\r\n",
      "political concessions that opened a quarter-century of civil war. Elizabeth rashly\r\n",

      "to seize the port of Le Havre and thus rekindling the hostility of the French\r\n",

      "the resources for an invasion (thanks to the continuing Mediterranean crisis), he\r\n",
      "could not take advantage of Elizabeth’s weakness; instead he should merely offer\r\n",
      "to mediate between England and France. To seek the queen’s deposition made\r\n",
      "no sense. Alba argued, because it would only benefit Mary Stuart - now back in\r\n",

      "credentials had become open to question. Although she subsequently played the\r\n",
      "role of Counter-Reformation martyr to perfection, it was a late development: in\r\n",
      "the 1560s almost all her Scottish ministers were Protestants and she eventually\r\n",
      "granted official recognition to the Reformed religion and married one of her\r\n",
      "Protestant subjects (the earl of Bothwell) according to the Reformed rite. Mary\r\n",
      "nevertheless remained a French princess: she wrote almost all her letters in French\r\n",
      "and in her will of 1566 all of the first seven (and ten of the first twelve)\r\n",
      "beneficiaries were her French relatives. Small wonder that Alba saw no advantage\r\n",
      "in toppling the unreliable but isolated Tudor queen simply to turn England\r\n",
      "into a French satellite under Mary Stuart. Philip therefore continued to protect\r\n",
      "Elizabeth without seeking anything in return. When in 1563 the council of\r\n",
      "Trent, ‘at the instance or insistence of some English bishops and other Catholics’,\r\n",

      "later that year, Philip refused to allow it to spread to Spain; and when in 1565\r\n",
      "Mary wrote to him for the first time, asking for aid against common enemies\r\n",

      "him.\r\n",
      "In the event Philip remained in Spain but his interest in the British question\r\n",
      "began to revive. In February 1568, for example, he wrote to ask his ambassador in\r\n",
      "London, Guzman de Silva, if ‘there is any hope of the queen some day coming to\r\n",
      "her senses and recognizing her error [i.e. her adherence to Protestantism], and also\r\n",
      "whether, in effect, there are any persons about her or in her council who may be\r\n",
      "able to lead her to this with credit and dignity’; he then added wearily, ‘so far as\r\n",
      "we can judge her by her words and actions, she seems so wedded to heresy that it\r\n",
      "will be difficult for her to free herself from it; but if I could in any way profitably\r\n",
      "help her to this end I would do so with all my heart’.^^ The letter offered no hint\r\n",
      "of aggressive intent. At just this moment, however, an unfortunate diplomatic\r\n",
      "incident concerning Elizabeth’s representative in Madrid set in train a major\r\n",
      "change of policy. Dr John Man, a Protestant cleric, had served the Tudors in\r\n",
      "minor diplomatic and administrative posts for over thirty years when in 1566\r\n",
      "Elizabeth appointed him to serve as her ambassador in Spain. Although Man\r\n",
      "could speak Italian, French and Latin, as the only Protestant ambassador (indeed\r\n",
      "the only ‘legal’ Protestant) in Madrid he proved unable to navigate a safe course\r\n",
      "among his embittered Catholic compatriots at the Spanish Court. By the summer\r\n",
      "of 1567 his dispatches recorded the hostility of the count of Feria, Philip’s former\r\n",
      "envoy to London and now (in Alba’s absence) his principal adviser on English\r\n",
      "affairs, as well as ‘the professed patron’ to all the English Catholic refugees in\r\n",
      "Spain. Before long, some of those exiles testified that Man had made invidious\r\n",
      "remarks about the Catholic faith and, one night at dinner, had insulted the pope\r\n",
      "(whom he called a ‘canting little monk’). Perhaps in retaliation, Man’s household\r\n",
      "received orders from the king to cease Protestant worship in the embassy and\r\n",
      "attend Catholic services instead. This infringed diplomatic convention (Catholic\r\n",
      "embassies in London always retained the right to celebrate Mass, and Guzman de\r\n",
      "Silva was himself a priest), but Philip persisted and in March 1568 refused to\r\n",
      "grant Man further audiences and exiled him from Court until he received permission\r\n",
      "to go home. The king virtuously informed the pope that the ambassador’s\r\n",
      "continued presence might cause offence to God ‘whose service, and the observation\r\n",
      "of whose holy faith, I place far ahead of my own affairs and actions and above\r\n",
      "everything in this life, even my own’.^^\r\n",

      "learned that Mary Stuart, having escaped from prison and taken part in an\r\n",
      "unsuccessful bid to regain power in Scotland, had sought refuge in England. Her\r\n",
      "agents immediately placed the Scottish queen in custody and soon arranged a\r\n",
      "trial at which her Scottish enemies presented evidence that she had murdered her\r\n",
      "second husband, thus apparently neutralizing (at least for a time) the threat that\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s enemies might seek to place her on the English throne. At the same\r\n",
      "time, another civil war broke out in France, which for the next two years again\r\n",
      "eliminated the risk of French intervention in British affairs.\r\n",

      "ambassador in London, Guzman de Silva, with the fiery and inexperienced Don\r\n",

      "Alba exploited his position as Philip’s security adviser for British affairs in\r\n",
      "order to create his own diplomatic links with England. Early in 1569 he sent over\r\n",
      "Christophe d’Assonleville, a Netherlands minister who had already undertaken\r\n",
      "several missions to London, in order to ascertain the queen’s true intentions and\r\n",
      "to do what he could to restore harmonious relations. D’Assonleville’s information,\r\n",
      "and the contacts he established, impressed the king and for a time he virtually\r\n",

      "Madrid was perhaps Elizabeth’s greatest asset during the series of crises that lay\r\n",
      "ahead.\r\n",
      "Long before d’Assonleville returned to Brussels, Alba warned the king that\r\n",
      "open war with England would be a mistake: Orange’s recent invasion had\r\n",
      "exhausted the Netherlands so that his government lacked ‘the ships and many\r\n",

      "resources to help Charles IX (a major expeditionary force left the Netherlands to\r\n",

      "good relations could be restored. The king immediately complied.^^ In mid-June\r\n",

      "although Philip again obliged, postal delays held his letter of authorization back\r\n",
      "for three months; and by the time it arrived other actors had appeared on the\r\n",
      "stage. In July 1568 Pope Pius V began to pressure Philip to invade England and\r\n",
      "restore Catholicism. Since the king showed little interest, early the following year\r\n",
      "Pius presented the duke of Alba with a golden sword (the mark of a warrior for the\r\n",
      "158 The Formation of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "faith) and, when this too produced no effect, in November 1569 he sent a letter\r\n",
      "that explicitly called on Alba to invade England. By then, although not yet privy\r\n",
      "to this papal summons, Philip had also become impatient with Elizabeth and\r\n",
      "decided that the time had come ‘to use force where reason has failed’. He drew\r\n",
      "encouragement from a rebellion against the queen by the Catholics of northern\r\n",
      "England, from the containment of the Morisco revolt, and from the victories of the\r\n",
      "French crown over its Protestant rebels (thanks in part to Spain’s military assistance):\r\n",
      "taken together, these three developments seemed to create a favourable\r\n",
      "situation for a more active policy against England. Furthermore the king considered\r\n",
      "that the long delay in securing restitution of the treasure seized by ‘that\r\n",
      "woman’ had ‘already begun to affect our prestige’. Late in 1569 Philip informed\r\n",
      "Alba that he now favoured sending money to Elizabeth’s northern rebels, encouraging\r\n",
      "the Irish Catholics to revolt, and actively supporting Mary Stuart’s claim to\r\n",
      "the English crown. Yet again, however, his nerve apparently failed him: conscious\r\n",
      "that he wrote far from events, the king concluded his letter with a disclaimer: ‘I\r\n",
      "only mention all this so that you will know what we are thinking here and so that,\r\n",
      "with your great prudence, and bearing in mind the state of affairs in all areas, you\r\n",
      "can consider what would be most appropriate.’^^\r\n",
      "The duke’s ‘great prudence’ dictated otherwise. Although sharing Philip’s\r\n",
      "frustration at the queen’s refusal to return the confiscated money, or even to\r\n",
      "discuss doing so, he resolutely rejected all talk of an open breach. By the time\r\n",
      "Philip’s letter arrived he had already poured sarcasm on the pope’s invitation to\r\n",
      "invade England:\r\n",
      "Such is the zeal and enthusiasm of His Holiness for the service of God, and so\r\n",
      "holy is his intention, that we might with justice judge him a heavenly rather\r\n",
      "than an earthly being since he places - as it is right to place - all trust in God.\r\n",
      "And if our sins did not get in the way of God’s purpose, no one could doubt\r\n",
      "that, without considering any human agency, we could have total confidence of\r\n",
      "success if we undertook any enterprise of this sort in this way. However, since\r\n",
      "worldly affairs form such a large part of us. His Holiness should not marvel if\r\n",
      "we might also want to make use of human agencies, so let me tell you what I\r\n",
      "think about these in as few words as possible . . .\r\n",
      "The duke conceded that ‘It would be easy for His Majesty to conquer England if\r\n",
      "the English had only their own forces with which to defend themselves’; but of\r\n",
      "course as soon as Philip started to attack England, France and the German princes\r\n",
      "would attack Philip’s possessions. Perhaps, the duke continued, France and Spain\r\n",
      "could carry out the invasion together and then partition the kingdom; but this too\r\n",
      "seemed impractical, because the victors would inevitably squabble over the exact\r\n",
      "division (he again cited the failed agreement to partition Naples earlier in the\r\n",

      "with orders both to ensure its diffusion in England and to take steps to depose\r\n",

      "By then Philip’s patience had finally run out. In January 1570 he angrily\r\n",
      "reminded Alba that Elizabeth had confiscated not only the treasure of his bankers\r\n",
      "but also the goods of his subjects in England; she had welcomed his rebels\r\n",
      "(perhaps 30,000 Dutch exiles, mostly Protestants and many of them implicated\r\n",
      "in the rebellions of 1566 and 1568, resided in England); she had broken off all\r\n",
      "trade; and she had licensed attacks on any ships sailing through the Channel\r\n",
      "under Spanish colours. ‘By contrast, the damage which she, her kingdom and\r\n",
      "her subjects have received from us is so little that it hardly counts ... so that one\r\n",
      "could justly say that she has declared war on us, but we are at peace with her.’ This\r\n",
      "unequal situation, the king insisted, could not be allowed to continue: a way of\r\n",
      "harming Elizabeth, and thus of bringing her back to peaceful coexistence, had to\r\n",
      "be found. His letter also contained, for the first time perhaps in over a decade, a\r\n",
      "‘messianic’ element. Philip reiterated his belief that God’s service ‘required’ him\r\n",
      "to intervene in order to liberate the Catholic queen of Scots and to restore\r\n",
      "Catholicism in England — especially since ‘God has already granted that by my\r\n",

      "rriade Philip ready — perhaps for the first but certainly not the last time in his\r\n",
      "reign — to throw caution to the winds. He informed Alba that:.\r\n",
      "Even though human prudence suggests many inconveniences and difficulties,\r\n",
      "and places before us worldly fears, Christian certitude and the confidence that\r\n",
      "we must justly have in the cause of God will remove them, and inspire and\r\n",
      "strengthen us to overcome them. Certainly we could not avoid remaining with\r\n",
      "great guilt in our soul, and great regret, if because I failed that queen [Mary]\r\n",
      "and those Catholics — or, rather, the faith — they suffered and she was lost.\r\n",
      "The king briefly reviewed several possible strategies for achieving these ends\r\n",
      "(conveniently forgetting that Alba had already scornfully rejected most of them):\r\n",
      "an outright invasion by his various forces; a joint invasion with the French; and an\r\n",
      "assault on Ireland (representatives of the Irish Catholics had recently arrived in\r\n",
      "Spain to secure his support). As usual he solicited Alba’s assessment of these plans,\r\n",
      "but this time he also ordered him secretly to provide both the English Catholics\r\n",
      "and Mary Stuart with money, arms and munitions, and to send military advisers\r\n",
      "to help train her supporters. To facilitate this, Philip enclosed a letter of credit for\r\n",
      "300,000 ducats.\r\n",
      "Alba remained totally unconvinced by both the spiritual blackmail and the\r\n",
      "strategic alternatives and he drew up a detailed rebuttal modelled on his reply to\r\n",
      "the pope two months earlier. He even adopted the same tone of heavy sarcasm\r\n",
      "i6o The Formation of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "towards Philip’s messianic imperialism: ‘Even though the principal means must\r\n",

      "had made it very clear that they did not want deliverance to come by means of a\r\n",
      "foreign army; finally he noted that the rising of the northern Catholics had ‘gone\r\n",
      "up in smoke’ (as he had always predicted, he added smugly). The duke felt more\r\n",

      "Ireland (especially since it was something ‘which Your Majesty will be better able\r\n",

      "News that the king of France had begun peace talks with the Huguenots\r\n",
      "temporarily cooled the king’s ardour, because an end to the civil wars (which duly\r\n",
      "occurred in August) would leave Charles IX free to assist Elizabeth if Spain\r\n",
      "attacked. In addition, the king’s tour of Andalusia (to restore confidence in the\r\n",
      "wake of the Morisco rebellion) and news of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus\r\n",
      "(beginning in July 1570) distracted him from other matters. So Philip sent\r\n",
      "mizabeth a message that the traditional Anglo-Spanish friendship would never\r\n",
      "be broken through a fault on his part; and he warned Spes to cease his plotting.\r\n",

      "that I am extremely determined and resolved to proceed and participate, doing\r\n",
      "on my side everything possible in this world to promote and assist it.\r\n",
      "Such rhetoric left Alba unmoved. Upon receiving the king’s letter he replied\r\n",

      "king of Spain would quickly complete the reconquest of the Low Countries and\r\n",
      "‘after that ... he will not fail to attack this kingdom [France} and England’.\r\n",

      "and, because the Salic Law restricted succession to the Erench crown to the nearest\r\n",
      "male relative of the monarch, his death left the Protestant Henry of Navarre as the\r\n",
      "new heir presumptive.\r\n",
      "In Spain, the death of Anjou caused both rejoicing and concern. It removed\r\n",
      "a thorn in Parma’s side in the Netherlands, allowing him to concentrate on the\r\n",
      "siege of Antwerp without fearing another ‘stab in the back’ from France. In\r\n",
      "February 1585 his engineers completed a massive fortified bridge across the\r\n",
      "Scheldt below Antwerp, in order to prevent the arrival of relief. But the prospect\r\n",
      "of Navarre’s succession to the French crown raised the spectre of an openly hostile\r\n",

      "he heard the news of Anjou’s death, the king commissioned Don Juan de Zuniga\r\n",
      "to work out the best policy to prevent this. Several cogent analytical papers came\r\n",
      "back within the week, all starting with the premise that ‘Your Majesty is obliged\r\n",
      "to make sure that no heretic succeeds [to the throne of France}, both because you\r\n",
      "have a duty always to defend and protect the Catholics and because any heretic\r\n",
      "must necessarily be an enemy of Your Majesty’. Zuniga perceived three ways of\r\n",
      "achieving this goal: open military intervention; an alliance with Henry III; or a\r\n",
      "secret alliance with the French Catholics. Since a declaration of war would prove\r\n",
      "ruinously expensive, and since Henry had shown himself to be ‘ill-willed and\r\n",
      "unstable up to now’, Zuniga recommended the third course of action - alliance\r\n",
      "with the French Catholics. At the same time, he noted that the Catholics had no\r\n",
      "credible candidate for the throne, should Henry die childless, and he therefore\r\n",
      "advocated marrying the duke of Savoy to one of Philip’s adolescent daughters,\r\n",

      "duke of Savoy, the Infanta would find a willing champion (see Table 3 on p. 79\r\n",

      "married Philip’s daughter Catalina.^^\r\n",

      "paramilitary organization, the ‘League’, dedicated to securing a Catholic succession.\r\n",
      "While Henry III negotiated with the Dutch about continuing French\r\n",
      "support for their struggle against Philip, Spanish envoys opened negotiations\r\n",
      "with Guise for a closer alliance. The offer of funds to help keep the League’s army\r\n",
      "prepared, and of military assistance should civil war break out, culminated in a\r\n",
      "treaty signed at Guise’s palace at Joinville on 31 December 1584 that guaranteed\r\n",

      "putting the venture into effect requires extensive preparations) excludes the\r\n",
      "possibility of doing it in 1586, and so it will have to be delayed until 1587-\r\n",
      "Second, because the total cost of the enterprise seemed likely to exceed 3 million\r\n",
      "ducats, while the war in the Netherlands already stretched Spain’s finances to the\r\n",
      "limit, the king declared himself ‘happy to contribute what he can, but states that\r\n",
      "it cannot be more than a third — or at the most a half — of the cost. The rest will\r\n",
      "have to come from {Rome and Florence} . In all other respects, however, Philip s\r\n",
      "response seemed positive, even enthusiastic.^\r\n",
      "The king now commissioned his principal adviser on foreign affairs, Don Juan\r\n",
      "de Zuniga, to prepare a thorough review of Spain’s security priorities in the light\r\n",
      "181\r\n",
      "of recent developments. Like his earlier analyses of the impact of the duke of\r\n",
      "Anjou s death (pp. 171-2 above), Zuniga’s position paper represented Spanish\r\n",
      "strategic planning at its best. He identified at the outset four major enemies — the\r\n",
      "Turks, the French, the Dutch and the English — and reasoned that the Turks,\r\n",
      "although previously Spain’s foremost antagonist, had committed so many resources\r\n",
      "to their struggle with Persia that Philip need only maintain a defensive\r\n",
      "posture in the Mediterranean; while the French, also formerly a major threat, now\r\n",
      "seemed so thoroughly mired in their own civil disputes that, although it might be\r\n",
      "necessary to intervene at some stage in order to prolong them, the cost to Philip\r\n",
      "would probably not be high. This left the Dutch and the English. The former had\r\n",
      "been a thorn in Spain’s flesh since the rebellion of 1572 because every Spanish\r\n",
      "success seemed to be followed by some countervailing reverse; but at least\r\n",
      "the problem, although costly and humiliating, remained confined to the Low\r\n",
      "Countries. The English menace was quite different: it had arisen recently and\r\n",
      "it threatened the entire Hispanic world, for Elizabeth clearly supported the\r\n",
      "Dutch and Dom Antonio as well as Drake. Zuniga argued that England had now\r\n",
      "openly broken with Spain and that to fight a purely defensive war is to court a\r\n",
      "huge and permanent expense, because we have to defend the Indies, Spain and the\r\n",
      "convoys travelling between them’. An amphibious operation of overwhelming\r\n",
      "strength, he reasoned, represented the most effective form of defence, and also the\r\n",
      "cheapest. The immediate diversion of resources to the Enterprise of England\r\n",
      "might temporarily compromise both the reconquest of the Netherlands and also\r\n",
      "the security of Spanish America; but Zuniga felt the risk must be taken because,\r\n",
      "so long as England remained uncowed, no part of Philip’s Monarchy would be\r\n",
      "safe.^\r\n",
      "Events soon vindicated Zuniga s analysis. On the one hand, Parma reported\r\n",
      "a massive build-up of English forces in Holland, paid for by English subsidies,\r\n",
      "culminating in December 1585 with the arrival of Elizabeth’s Favourite, the earl\r\n",
      "of Leicester, to serve as governor-general of the rebellious provinces. On the other\r\n",
      "hand, a constant stream of information poured back to Spain on the destruction\r\n",
      "caused by Drake in the Canaries, in the Cape Verde Islands and finally in the\r\n",
      "Caribbean (where he sacked first Santo Domingo, then Cartagena and finally St\r\n",
      "Augustine). According to one of Drake s companions, the expedition caused\r\n",
      "300,000 ducats worth of damage ‘upon the co[a}ste of Spaine’ and ‘300 millions’\r\n",
      "in the Indies, while, in Germany, Elizabeth s envoy Sir Horatio Pallavicino\r\n",
      "gloated that Drake s voyage had damaged Philip in two distinct ways: by reducing\r\n",
      "his revenues as well as by increasing his costs, ‘since it is most certain that one\r\n",
      "year of war in the Indies will cost the Spaniards more than three years of war in\r\n",
      "the Netherlands . In Madrid, Cardinal Granvelle spoke for almost everyone when\r\n",
      "he fretted, I keenly regret that the queen of England makes war on us so boldly\r\n",
      "and dishonestly, and that we cannot get our own back’.^“\r\n",
      "Small wonder, then, that the king became increasingly anxious to secure the\r\n",
      "pope s agreement for an outright attack on England. On 6 November 1585, two\r\n",
      "weeks after his initial favourable response, Philip instructed Ambassador Olivares\r\n",
      "The ‘Enterprise of England’, iy8y~88\r\n",
      "i82 The Formation of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "to ascertain whether Sixtus V truly desired the invasion of England, or whether\r\n",
      "the proposal merely emanated from the grand duke of Tuscany and the late\r\n",
      "Gregory XIII, whereas the new pope ‘himself inclines rather to some other\r\n",
      "enterprise’.\" When confirmation on this point duly arrived, the king dictated and\r\n",
      "signed two letters which committed him not only to carry out the conquest of\r\n",
      "England but also to employ - as intended in both 1571 and 1575-77 - the Army\r\n",
      "of Flanders to achieve it. On 29 December 1585 he invited the prince of Parma,\r\n",
      "fresh from his triumphant reconquest of most of Flanders and Brabant, to propose\r\n",
      "a suitable strategy for invasion. Four days later he authorized Olivares to discuss\r\n",
      "with the pope certain political questions arising from the operation — how would\r\n",
      "the invasion be justified to the world; what role would His Holiness and the\r\n",

      "force.\"\r\n",
      "It was, of course, one thing to decide that the England must be invaded, and\r\n",
      "quite another to make it happen. Nevertheless, nine English governments had\r\n",
      "been overthrown or seriously undermined by seaborne invasions in the five centuries\r\n",
      "since the Norman Conquest of 1066, with at least seven other successful\r\n",
      "landings of major forces, and many more lesser raids (as well as seaborne assistance\r\n",
      "against England sent to Scotland or Ireland). Philip II and his ministers compiled\r\n",

      "consisted of a simultaneous combined operation by a fleet strong enough both to\r\n",
      "defeat the opposing English navy and to shepherd across the Channel an army\r\n",
      "sufficient to accomplish the conquest (as William I had done in 1066 with\r\n",
      "spectacular success). The second possible strategy involved assembling an army in\r\n",
      "secret near the Channel while launching a diversionary assault on Ireland which\r\n",
      "would draw off most of England’s defenders, leaving the mainland relatively open\r\n",
      "to invasion by the main force (the Smerwick operation of 1579—80 seemed to\r\n",
      "show the way). Finally, a surprise assault might be essayed (as, most recently,\r\n",
      "Edward of York had done in 1471 and Henry Tudor in 1485).\" That all these\r\n",
      "possible strategies received consideration in 1586—88 reflects great credit on the\r\n",
      "vision and competence of Philip and his ‘national security advisers’; that they tried\r\n",
      "to undertake all three of them at once does not.\r\n",
      "Confusion began to creep in when in January 1586 the king invited Santa Cruz\r\n",
      "to assess how many ships and men would be needed to protect the coasts of Spain\r\n",
      "and Portugal from further humiliating raids by ‘pirates’ like Drake. The marquis\r\n",
      "obliged the following month, but accompanied his list with an eloquent plea that\r\n",
      "the best way to defend the peninsula against the threat from England would be to\r\n",
      "attack England itself, and (somewhat presumptuously) offered ‘to serve Your\r\n",

      "to establish a fortified base in the Caribbean, led the king to authorize\r\n",

      "arm suitable ships in the Cantabrian ports in order to form two new squadrons:\r\n",
      "one composed of large merchantmen, the other comprising smaller vessels and\r\n",

      "ambassador ruefully admitted, ‘The reports flowing in from all parts concerning\r\n",
      "the preparations that Your Majesty is making, which may be for this venture, have\r\n",
      "done much harm’, because the pope argued that, since Spain clearly intended to\r\n",
      "press ahead anyway, it could do so without a papal subsidy. Sixtus offered 300,000\r\n",
      "ducats, in lieu of the million requested.\r\n",
      "While the king pondered this disappointing response, a messenger arrived at\r\n",
      "Court with Parma’s long-awaited proposal for the invasion of England. The 28-\r\n",
      "page document began by regretting the lack of secrecy surrounding the king’s\r\n",
      "intentions. The prince asserted that even ordinary soldiers and civilians in the\r\n",
      "The‘Enterprise of England’, iy8y-88 185\r\n",
      "Netherlands now openly discussed the best way to invade England. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "he believed that three basic precautions might still save the enterprise. First, the\r\n",
      "king of Spain must have sole charge ‘without placing any reliance on either the\r\n",
      "English themselves, or the assistance of other allies’. Second, the French must be\r\n",
      "prevented from interfering, either by sending assistance to Elizabeth or by intervening\r\n",
      "in the Netherlands. Third, sufficient troops and resources must remain\r\n",
      "behind to defend the reconquered Netherlands against the Dutch once the assault\r\n",
      "force had left.\r\n",
      "After meeting these conditions, Parma suggested detaching a force of 30,000\r\n",
      "foot and 500 horse from the Army of Flanders and ferrying it across the Channel\r\n",
      "aboard a flotilla of seagoing barges to launch a surprise attack on England.\r\n",
      "Provided his precise intentions remained a secret, ‘given the number of troops we\r\n",
      "have to hand here, and the ease with which we can concentrate and embark\r\n",
      "them in the barges, and considering that we can ascertain, at any moment, the\r\n",
      "forces which Elizabeth has and can be expected to have, and that the crossing\r\n",
      "only takes 10 to 12 hours without a following wind (and 8 hours with one)’, the\r\n",
      "prince felt sure the invasion could be undertaken with a fair chance of success.\r\n",
      "The most suitable, close and accessible point of disembarkation [he concluded},\r\n",
      "is the coast between Dover and Margate’, which would permit a rapid march on\r\n",
      "London. In essence, this represented the third alternative invasion strategy: a\r\n",
      "surprise assault.\r\n",
      "Only two paragraphs of the letter addressed the possibility of naval support\r\n",
      "from Spain, and even then only in the context of ‘the worst case scenario’: that\r\n",
      "somehow details of the plan had become known in England. In that case, Parma\r\n",
      "since Drake s exploits had forced the king to mobilize a fleet to protect\r\n",
      "the Atlantic, perhaps this new navy might ‘either sail suddenly up here in order\r\n",
      "to assist and reinforce the troops who have already landed [in Kent} and keep open\r\n",
      "the seaway between the coasts of Flanders and England; or else - if your fleet is\r\n",
      "large, well-provided, well-armed and well-manned - it could create a diversion\r\n",
      "which will draw the English fleet away [from the straits of Dover}’. This corresponded\r\n",
      "to the third alternative strategy for invading England, the one later\r\n",
      "favoured by Napoleon: a naval decoy to facilitate an attack by a relatively unprotected\r\n",
      "invasion army.^^\r\n",
      "To some extent, the long delay before Parma’s proposal arrived at Court\r\n",
      "reduced its appeal. The king had asked for it in December 1585; yet Parma only\r\n",
      "complied four months later, entrusting it to a special messenger, Giovanni\r\n",

      "concerned with the war with England, and some clearly influenced by Castro’s\r\n",
      "attitude. Moreover he managed to send these papers directly to the\r\n",

      "Orders went out for the new defensive squadrons raised in northern Spain to sail\r\n",

      "he informed the council, ‘but your plan presents a lot of problems, and the biggest\r\n",
      "one is the lack of money with which to pay for it all’. In 1588 Philip likewise\r\n",

      "were laid to put Mary on trial for treason.\r\n",
      "Philip’s diplomats elsewhere proved more successful. In May 1587, after prolonged\r\n",
      "negotiations, his ambassador to the Catholic Swiss cantons concluded a\r\n",
      "treaty which (in return for some pensions and customs concessions) guaranteed the\r\n",
      "security of Franche-Comte and the duchy of Milan, and secured the right of\r\n",
      "Spanish troops to pass through the cantons from Italy to Germany and the\r\n",

      "Philip the right to choose the next ruler of England. Both points provoked\r\n",
      "tortuous and acrimonious negotiations. On the question of finance, discussions\r\n",

      "that would trigger the transfer of funds (the departure of the Armada from Lisbon,\r\n",
      "or the landing of the invasion force on English soil?), and on the risk that, if Sixtus\r\n",
      "died unexpectedly, his successor might refuse to honour the commitment. To\r\n",
      "secure the last point, in November 1586 the king insisted that all the cardinals\r\n",
      "must forthwith swear that, should they be elected pope in the event of Sixtus’s\r\n",
      "death, they would honour his promise to pay. The king acknowledged the risk\r\n",
      "that this involved:\r\n",

      "it may require a meeting of the College of Cardinals, nonetheless it is a point\r\n",

      "Shortly after this, Olivares secured a promise that i million ducats would be paid\r\n",
      "as soon as proof arrived that Spanish forces had landed in England.” He also\r\n",
      "reached a temporary solution to the ‘investiture’ problem: Mary Stuart would be\r\n",

      "However, Mary Stuart’s execution on a charge of treason by her English captors\r\n",
      "in February 1587 nullified this arrangement. At first, armed with family trees and\r\n",
      "dynastic treatises, Philip now set out to prove that he was himself heir presumptive\r\n",
      "to the English throne by virtue of his descent from the house of Lancaster. In\r\n",
      "the end his advisers dissuaded him from making this claim public, on the grounds\r\n",

      "Strangely enough, they failed only in Scotland, thanks largely to Mary’s\r\n",

      "de Mendoza, that she intended to ‘cede and grant by Will my right to the\r\n",

      "overwhelming strength; the latter introduced a critical new dimension.\r\n",
      "Ever since receiving his copy of the masterplan, Parma had repeatedly expressed\r\n",

      "pressed for details both on its itinerary and on its proposed junction with his\r\n",

      "and the eastern ports, with those in the south and west, so that the enemy will not\r\n",

      "on their role, to answer their questions and to provide feedback on the state of\r\n",
      "their readiness and morale.\r\n",
      "Shortly before receiving these orders, however, Parma suddenly (and, in hindsight,\r\n",
      "inexplicably) became more optimistic. He now suggested to the king that,\r\n",
      "after all, if Santa Cruz could get his Armada as far as the Channel approaches it\r\n",
      "might draw the Royal Navy down to Plymouth, creating a window of opportunity\r\n",

      "planned; he also indicated that he would have everything entirely ready for the\r\n",
      "crossing by early December. The king was overjoyed by this news and on the 30th\r\n",
      "wrote to override the strict prohibition on independent action in his recent\r\n",

      "depleted by disease, and his provisions almost all consumed by the ten-week\r\n",

      "question for the time being.\r\n",
      "Far away in the Escorial, Philip simply refused to believe this. Convinced that\r\n",

      "Santa Cruz: ‘There is no more time to waste in requests and replies,’ he informed\r\n",
      "the marquis curtly; ‘just get on with the job and see if you cannot advance the\r\n",
      "agreed departure date [25 October] by a few days’. As the deadline approached,\r\n",

      "imagine. And so I charge and command you most strictly to leave before the\r\n",

      "Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, just possibly exploiting the knowledge that his\r\n",
      "co-commander was still not prepared, Parma boasted to the king on 14 November\r\n",
      "that:\r\n",
      "Everything here will be ready and in being by the 20th., and ... I am entirely\r\n",
      "resolved, in the name of God and with His holy assistance, to put to sea myself\r\n",

      "of letters urging Santa Cruz to put to sea even if he could lead only 48 seaworthy\r\n",
      "ships (10 December), and then even if he had only 35 (21 December). The king\r\n",

      "century, ‘acquisition’ generally fell into one of two categories: intelligence from\r\n",
      "intercepted communications or from individuals. Most of it seems modest by\r\n",
      "modern standards. Since it is far easier to intercept radio signals than couriers,\r\n",
      "espionage proved relatively unsuccessful against Philip IPs communication\r\n",
      "systems, particularly in the case of operational intelligence (because of the need\r\n",

      "The testimony of the Spaniards captured on the Armada itself could hardly be\r\n",
      "ignored, however. Just after the Grand Fleet entered the Channel, Sir Francis\r\n",

      "The Worst-kept Secret in Europe?\r\n",

      "among the English fleet), and some 250 prisoners (most of them immediately sent\r\n",
      "to London for interrogation). Only Don Pedro de Valdes, one of the Armada’s\r\n",

      "ashore, the English Privy Council interrogated some forty other captives\r\n",
      "from the Rosario on 12 August. They asked, for example, ‘Whether the intention\r\n",
      "of the fleet was to invade and conquer England or no’; ‘Where they should have\r\n",
      "landed; and whether their meaning were to take the City of London; and what\r\n",

      "of any help or succour that they should receive upon their landing in England’ -\r\n",
      "and question 15- ‘Whether there be any other preparation to come hereafter for\r\n",
      "the defence of this fleet’. Their responses proved alarming: on the first issue the\r\n",
      "prisoners answered that they expected between one-third and one-half of the\r\n",
      "population of England to support the invasion; on the second they replied that\r\n",
      "a considerable reserve fleet was in preparation in Lisbon for dispatch against\r\n",
      "England. It seems likely that this information - although false - contributed\r\n",
      "directly towards the ruthless treatment of the Armada survivors forced ashore on\r\n",
      "the coasts of Ireland in the following month: fearing that they might constitute\r\n",
      "the advance units of a second fleet, and with fewer than 750 English soldiers\r\n",
      "stationed in all Ireland, as a panic measure the government decided ‘to apprehend\r\n",
      "and execute all Spaniards found, of what quality soever’.\r\n",
      "Such intelligence coups remained few. Although England regularly sent ships\r\n",
      "to cruise off the coast of Spain in order to intercept merchant vessels and interrogate\r\n",
      "(and sometimes abduct) their masters and crews, most of those captured\r\n",
      "had no access to strategic information; and even the light they could shed on\r\n",
      "operational matters was usually limited.^^ Moreover they often became, in effect,\r\n",
      "double-agents for they could pick up as much data as they gave. Thus the\r\n",
      "unfortunate magistrate captured aboard the Primrose at Bilbao in 1585 returned to\r\n",
      "Spain with precious details on the Royal Navy’s preferred tactics; two mastermariners\r\n",
      "captured in 1586, and taken back to England for questioning, on their\r\n",
      "release provided valuable detail on Elizabeth’s preparations and even the names of\r\n",
      "some of Elizabeth’s spies in Spain; others supplied a detailed description of the\r\n",
      "English warships, listing the guns aboard and comparing them with Armada\r\n",
      "vessels.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s government therefore relied, for most of its knowledge about\r\n",
      "Philip s plans, on its agents and friends overseas. Some data came from the\r\n",
      "The Execution of Grand Strategy 215\r\n",
      "couriers who carried diplomatic messages between England and the continent:\r\n",
      "ministers routinely debriefed them on what they had seen and heard. More\r\n",
      "originated with ‘Englishmen abroad’ who reported their impressions by letter.\r\n",
      "One of the most exact accounts of the invasion transports assembled in the ports\r\n",
      "of Flanders by the duke of Parma came from an English sailor who arrived at\r\n",
      "Dunkirk to unload a consignment of good English beer for the diplomats at\r\n",
      "Bourbourg (whose patriotic stomachs churned upon imbibing the local brew). His\r\n",
      "experienced mariner’s eye quickly noted the numbers, strengths and weaknesses\r\n",
      "of the duke’s fleet, which he promptly wrote down and sent back to London.\r\n",
      "Foreign well-wishers also contributed some intelligence: thus the Protestant\r\n",
      "rulers of northern Europe regularly passed on any information that came their way\r\n",
      "about Catholic designs against their English ally.^’^ And from Portugal the queen\r\n",
      "could count on information supplied by those who sympathized with the Portuguese\r\n",
      "pretender’, Dom Antonio, a refugee at the Tudor Court after 1585. The\r\n",
      "papers of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth’s secretary of state and principal\r\n",
      "‘spymaster’, contain a number of detailed reports on the preparation of the\r\n",
      "Armada sent from Lisbon by Philip’s disaffected new subjects.\r\n",
      "These agents too, however, rarely enjoyed access to secrets of state: although\r\n",
      "they could supply information on the mobilization of Philip s resources, they\r\n",
      "could neither fathom their purpose nor foretell the likely moment or manner of\r\n",
      "their deployment. For this, Elizabeth’s government needed to penetrate the\r\n",
      "communications network of Spain and its allies. Admittedly, reading the mail\r\n",
      "of people close to, though still outside, the centres of government could provide\r\n",
      "valuable operational information: the location of the writer’s unit and what it\r\n",
      "planned to do; recent movements of troops and munitions; the state of local\r\n",
      "morale. Thus an intercepted letter from an Italian merchant in Brussels to a friend\r\n",
      "in Spain on 30 June 1588 provided not only precise details on the programme for\r\n",
      "the embarkation of Parma’s troops in Flanders but also a copy of the pope s special\r\n",
      "indulgence for all who joined the ‘crusade’ to conquer England — thus revealing\r\n",
      "beyond all doubt, for those who would listen, the Armada’s principal objective. ^\r\n",
      "Yet although events would confirm every detail in this letter, it remained barely\r\n",
      "distinguishable from the host of other, contradictory messages, most of them\r\n",
      "equally plausible, intercepted by the queen’s agents.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s ministers desperately needed information from the pen of the king\r\n",
      "himself in order to evaluate the other material; but this they rarely managed to\r\n",
      "intercept. Part of the problem lay in the fact that Philip and his envoys abroad\r\n",
      "wrote their letters in complex codes. For example, each secretary of state normally\r\n",
      "used a ‘general cipher’ for his correspondence with ministers abroad, and these\r\n",
      "changed as a matter of routine every few years; in addition, they employed a\r\n",
      "special cipher to communicate with groups of senior officials (for example with\r\n",
      "the governor-general in Brussels and the ambassadors in London, Paris and\r\n",
      "Vienna, and each of these ministers used the same cipher when they corresponded\r\n",
      "among themselves). Furthermore, individuals in particularly sensitive circumstances\r\n",
      "abroad might be given a totally different - unique - cipher. Finally, at\r\n",
      "The Worst-kept Secret in Europe?\r\n",
      "2i6 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "times of acute uncertainty, distinct codes might be used for alternate paragraphs\r\n",
      "in the same letter.^® Even these precautions did not always suffice, however.\r\n",
      "Occasionally, a key might be lost (all Spain’s ciphers had to be changed in 1564,\r\n",
      "for example, after the waylaying of an ambassador’s servant); or an enemy might\r\n",
      "intercept a ciphered copy of a document already possessed en clair (a high\r\n",
      "risk during peace negotiations, where both sides would discuss copies of the same\r\n",
      "documents).^^ Finally a corrupt official might give or sell codes to an enemy; in\r\n",
      "1576 and 1577 the Dutch managed to decode almost all intercepted letters\r\n",
      "exchanged between Philip and his agents in the Netherlands, apparently due to\r\n",
      "the betrayal of cipher keys by the chief clerk of the Spanish secretary of state.But\r\n",
      "could codes be broken without help of this sort? The evidence is ambiguous.\r\n",

      "insufficient to establish the truth, Khevenhiiller could call upon the dowager\r\n",
      "Empress Maria, Rudolf s mother and Philip’s sister, who had retired to a Madrid\r\n",

      "brother the Archduke Albert, who as viceroy of Portugal supervised all preparations\r\n",
      "for the Armada at Lisbon.Although the imperial embassy staff remained\r\n",
      "small - only 4 or 5, compared with 14 or 15 for Mantua - Khevenhiiller could\r\n",

      "The Worst-kept Secret in Europe?\r\n",
      "222 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "that he lacked funds to discharge his responsibilities properly and asked the queen\r\n",

      "time being this challenge silenced all criticism of Parma ashore, naturally it had\r\n",
      "no effect aboard the Spanish Armada. The fleet had been driven away from Calais\r\n",
      "by English fireships on the night of 7/8 August, and then attacked and bombarded\r\n",
      "at close range by the entire Royal Navy in a battle off the Flemish coast,\r\n",

      "expert surmised that ‘Parma has reason to be, after King Philip, the most\r\n",
      "desperate man in the world’. In October the Florentine ambassador in Madrid\r\n",
      "reported that ‘all the Spaniards, and especially those who returned on the Armada’\r\n",
      "both ‘in public and in private’ blamed its failure on ‘the delays of the duke of\r\n",
      "Parma ... so the poor gentleman will need a good excuse’.^\r\n",
      "The duke already realized his peril: the Armada had hardly moved into the\r\n",
      "North Sea when he wrote to urge his uncle. Cardinal Farnese, who watched over\r\n",
      "the family’s interests in Rome, to provide immediate refutation ‘if it should\r\n",
      "happen that, either to exculpate the duke of Medina Sidonia or for some other\r\n",

      "their nation’; and in October he sent a special envoy to Italy in order to defend his\r\n",
      "conduct.^ Unfortunately, he chose for this mission Count Niccolo Cesi, a somewhat\r\n",
      "blunt soldier raised in the Farnese household who seems to have blamed\r\n",
      "Medina Sidonia instead. The outraged Spanish ambassador in Rome (who happened\r\n",
      "to be Medina’s cousin) wrote to chide Parma for his disloyalty and pettiness;\r\n",
      "‘It was God’s will, not your fault — and not Medina’s’. And in any case, the\r\n",
      "ambassador added tartly, ‘explanations of how each commander behaved are due\r\n",
      "to His Majesty and to nobody else’.^\r\n",
      "The duke had already taken care of this, too. On the very day of the battle off\r\n",
      "the Flemish coast he penned a preliminary ‘explanation’ to his master:\r\n",
      "Those who came here off the fleet and have tried to give the impression that we\r\n",
      "were not ready - because they could not see guns and munitions on my ships,\r\n",
      "nor the troops aboard — are mistaken. Everything was prepared as it should have\r\n",
      "been for the Channel crossing . . . Nothing would have been gained by embarking\r\n",
      "in advance because the ships are so small that there is not even room to\r\n",
      "turn round. Undoubtedly the men would have sickened, the food would have\r\n",
      "putrefied and everything would have perished.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless the king and his ministers remained doubtful. When Secretary of\r\n",
      "State Don Juan de Idiaquez acknowledged receipt of this letter he began by noting\r\n",
      "acerbically that it had been written at Bruges, ‘which is a long way from\r\n",
      "Dunkirk’.^ Before long diplomats at the Court of Spain noted that ‘many people\r\n",
      "are talking about the duke of Parma, since it seems to some that he has not done\r\n",
      "everything he should’, and so in November Idiaquez became more direct. Having\r\n",
      "231\r\n",
      "assured the duke that ‘you have no truer servant in any country than me’, and after\r\n",
      "dismissing ‘the lies sowed by the ignorant, the malicious, and those who are\r\n",
      "looking for an excuse’, he regretted that there remained a ‘cloud to dispel’ because\r\n",
      "some continued to assert that Parma would have needed two weeks to embark his\r\n",
      "forces. Therefore, Idiaquez continued disarmingly but firmly:\r\n",
      "So that we, your servants, can (when occasion arises) counter with confidence\r\n",
      "and with substance the confusion over whether your army and its transports\r\n",
      "were or were not ready when the Armada arrived, please will Your Excellency\r\n",
      "tell me clearly on which day of August you intended to cross, had the fleet not\r\n",
      "sailed away?^\r\n",
      "This time Parma’s reply proved more cautious. He devoted several paragraphs to\r\n",
      "disowning the conduct of Niccolo Cesi who, he claimed, had been sent to Rome\r\n",
      "merely because Cardinal Farnese had fallen ill and it seemed important to have\r\n",
      "someone at the papal Court to protect his reputation; he had never intended to\r\n",
      "blame others. Next he defended the readiness of his forces.\r\n",
      "On Monday 7 August, which was the day that [Medina Sidonia’s} Secretary\r\n",
      "Arceo arrived [with the news that the Armada had reached Calais] and the day\r\n",
      "I left Bruges, I had 16,000 infantry embarked in Nieuwpoort; and when I\r\n",
      "arrived at Dunkirk, which was on Tuesday the 8th, the troops who were to\r\n",
      "embark there had arrived before dawn and were beginning to board, and they\r\n",
      "finished that same day together with the munitions and all the other things\r\n",
      "which were ready and prepared. We were embarking at top speed {a furid\\, and\r\n",
      "we would certainly have finished. Had we not called a halt in view of the news\r\n",
      "we received of the Armada, we could well have begun to sail out that same\r\n",
      "night, and joined the Nieuwpoort contingent together with that from Dunkirk\r\n",
      "in order to effect their task [i.e. the invasion] that night and part of the next\r\n",
      "day, because they lacked nothing that they needed.\r\n",
      "He concluded defiantly: ‘My statement that we needed no more than three days to\r\n",
      "embark and be ready to sail forth was not made without justification.’\r\n",
      "Some doubts still lingered, however. In June 1589 the duke felt moved to send\r\n",
      "copies of all the relevant Armada documents to Court - nine letters from Medina\r\n",
      "Sidonia to Parma; six letters back (and Parma’s instruction to one of the messengers);\r\n",
      "memoranda of the artillery, munitions and food prepared for the embarkation;\r\n",
      "all major letters to the king - together with another attempt at exculpation.\r\n",
      "Perhaps rashly Parma also added some barbed comments about the unwisdom of\r\n",
      "the entire enterprise, provoking a long response from the king which (in effect)\r\n",
      "told him to stop complaining and to concentrate instead on current matters.\r\n",
      "And there the issue seems to have rested, at least for Philip and his ministers.\r\n",
      "So where did the truth lie? The disappearance of several key papers complicates\r\n",
      "the search for certainty; the government’s archives in Brussels and Simancas, as\r\n",
      "Was Parma Ready?\r\n",
      "232\r\n",
      "well as the Parma family papers in Naples and Parma, have all suffered major\r\n",
      "losses/^ Furthermore, on the one hand, the surviving testimony of the duke\r\n",
      "himself might have been biased, since upon its acceptance depended his reputation\r\n",
      "and perhaps even his life; while the favourable opinion of those in his\r\n",
      "entourage might be explained by a sense of personal loyalty or even by bribes/^\r\n",
      "On the other hand, Parma had already made a number of enemies who, both then\r\n",
      "and later, welcomed every opportunity to discredit him. Juan Moreo, who had\r\n",
      "played a prominent part in negotiating the treaty of Joinville and later served\r\n",
      "as chief liaison officer with the French Catholic League, noted in 1586 that ‘the\r\n",
      "duke of Parma has assumed great authority over His Majesty’s affairs, and handles\r\n",
      "them very imperiously’. A month later the new inspector-general of the Army of\r\n",
      "Flanders, Juan Bautista de Tassis, likewise complained of Parma’s proprietorial\r\n",
      "attitude and his resentment of criticism. Both men renewed their complaints\r\n",
      "subsequently, contributing to the king’s later decision to recall Parma and\r\n",
      "subject his entire administration to a rigorous visita (or judicial review), and so\r\n",
      "their hostile retrospective evaluation of Parma’s conduct in 1588 also remains\r\n",
      "suspect^. 14\r\n",
      "The critical issue, however, is not whether absolutely everything in Flanders\r\n",
      "had been perfected for the Enterprise of England in the first week of August 1588,\r\n",
      "but whether enough had been done to permit the invasion force to join up with\r\n",
      "the Armada, had it been able to remain in (or return to) the Narrow Seas. The\r\n",
      "question ‘Was Parma ready?’, on which the success of the entire venture depended,\r\n",
      "can only be answered by examining in detail the strategic, logistical and\r\n",
      "operational evidence and the testimony of friends and foes alike.\r\n",
      "In 1586, in response to Philip’s request for a blueprint for the invasion of\r\n",
      "England, Parma had proposed a surprise attack on the coast of Kent by a force of\r\n",
      "30,000 infantry and 500 cavalry drawn from the Army of Flanders carried by a\r\n",
      "fleet of barges guarded by a small escort of warships. The king eventually rejected\r\n",
      "this relatively simple strategy in favour of a combined operation that involved\r\n",
      "dispatching a powerful warfleet from Spain which would drive away the Royal\r\n",
      "Navy and, taking up station off Margate (a location subsequently referred to, for\r\n",
      "security reasons, as ‘the appointed place’), protect Parma’s army while it crossed\r\n",
      "from the ports of Flanders to the coast of Kent. The Armada would provide the\r\n",
      "firepower both afloat and, in the shape of the magnificent siege-train it carried,\r\n",
      "ashore; Parma would supply the invasion troops and their equipment, together\r\n",
      "with the landing craft to transport them. Neither force could succeed without the\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "Philip’s final instructions to Medina Sidonia, signed on i April 1588, made\r\n",
      "clear that Parma’s invasion force could only set forth after the fleet had secured\r\n",
      "local command of the sea; and a personal letter added the warning that:\r\n",
      "As for ships to land troops, remember that the duke of Parma has a large\r\n",
      "number of these — barges, coasters and other vessels suitable for this effect;\r\n",
      "The Execution of Grand Strategy 233\r\n",
      "but all his vessels are of this type, and not of {sufficient} size and force to\r\n",
      "fight. That is why he must wait until the Armada arrives and secures his\r\n",
      "crossi• ng. 16\r\n",
      "Medina seems to have missed this point completely. In June, as his fleet\r\n",
      "approached Cape Finisterre, he blithely informed Parma that ‘I am coming to find\r\n",
      "Your Excellency, and will write to you when I enter the Channel to tell you where\r\n",
      "this fleet is, so that Your Excellency can lead his [ships} out’. Medina even sent an\r\n",
      "extra pinnace ‘so that Your Excellency can use it to tell me the state in which you\r\n",
      "find yourself, when you can come out, and where we can meet’. The king, upon\r\n",
      "reading a copy of this letter, immediately spotted the error, and scribbled in the\r\n",
      "margin, ‘This cannot be unless he [Medina} makes it safe first.’ He lost no time in\r\n",
      "firing off an anguished protest:\r\n",
      "I will not repeat here what I have told you so often, except to say that . . . the\r\n",
      "main point [of the plan} was to go on until you could join hands with the duke\r\n",
      "my nephew ... I am sure you will have done this, and proceeded to that\r\n",
      "location and made safe the duke’s transit, because his ships are not able to come\r\n",
      "out and meet you further off until you have cleared the crossing of enemies:\r\n",
      "they are merely transport vessels, not fighting ships.\r\n",
      "Even this apparently clear statement seems to have missed its mark, for Medina\r\n",
      "remained utterly convinced that Parma could bring out his ships to meet him off\r\n",
      "‘Cape Margate’. Immediately after leaving Corunna, one month later, he once\r\n",
      "again erroneously informed the king that ‘the intention is that the duke of Parma\r\n",
      "should come out with his ships to the place where I arrive [that is, to the coast of\r\n",
      "Kent} without making me wait for him for a moment. On this depends the whole\r\n",
      "success of the campaign.’\r\n",
      "Medina also sent a messenger to Flanders as soon as he had cleared the coast of\r\n",
      "Spain. As he led the fleet into the English Channel one week later he complained\r\n",
      "to the king that he had still not heard a word from Parma, ‘which amazes me’, so\r\n",
      "that ‘we are travelling almost with our eyes closed’.Accordingly he wrote again\r\n",
      "to Flanders as the fleet sailed past Portland Bill on i August to ‘ascertain from\r\n",
      "Your Excellency what I should do, and where I should wait, in order for us to join\r\n",
      "forces’, and with the same courier Don Francisco de Bobadilla sent a letter urging\r\n",
      "Parma ‘to come out in person as soon as you see this fleet in the anchorage that it\r\n",
      "should reach [i.e. “the appointed place”}, even if it cannot be with all the ships and\r\n",
      "troops that you have’. Off the Isle of Wight on 4 August, still without word from\r\n",
      "Flanders, Medina wrote once more to remind Parma that ‘Your Excellency should\r\n",
      "be ready to put to sea and find me’ literally at a moment’s notice. Off Beachy Head\r\n",
      "on the 5 th, after three days of long-range bombardment ‘from dawn until dusk’\r\n",
      "without being able to force a fleet action, it occurred to Medina that perhaps the\r\n",
      "small warships assembled by Parma in Dunkirk might be able to close with the\r\n",
      "English and engage them until his bigger vessels could get alongside and board.\r\n",
      "Was Parma Ready?\r\n",
      "234\r\n",

      "flyboats or other small and light warships’ immediately.^^\r\n",
      "In spite of all this, no word had come from Flanders by the next morning, when\r\n",
      "the Armada sighted the French coast near Boulogne. What should Medina\r\n",
      "Sidonia do now? The English fleet remained only five kilometres astern, so that\r\n",
      "anchoring off the Kent coast near Margate - as Philip had instructed - no longer\r\n",
      "made sense. So the duke resolved to\r\n",
      "steer a course for the Calais roads, which we reached at 4 p.m. There were\r\n",
      "different opinions on whether to anchor in that roadstead, and most favoured\r\n",
      "going on; but the duke, understanding from the pilots he brought with him\r\n",
      "that if he proceeded further the currents would force him out of the Channel\r\n",
      "and into the North Sea, determined to anchor before Calais, seven leagues from\r\n",
      "Dunkirk, where Parma could come and join him. And so at 5 p.m. he ordered\r\n",
      "the whole fleet to drop anchor.\r\n",
      "Medina now wrote to ask Parma once again for the ‘40 or 50 flyboats’ so that ‘we\r\n",
      "can hold off the fleet of the enemy until Your Excellency can come with all the rest\r\n",
      "[of your forces} and we can capture some port where this Armada can anchor in\r\n",

      "realities of naval warfare: one cannot imagine his predecessor, Santa Cru2, making\r\n",
      "the same elementary mistake. It never seems to have occurred to the duke that all\r\n",
      "his messengers had either to run the gauntlet of the hostile ships lurking in the\r\n",
      "Channel, or else to make for the French coast and hope to find a relay of horses\r\n",

      "nonsense of his message. The envoy sent from the Bay of Biscay on 25 July in an\r\n",
      "‘armed pinnace with six oars’ took only seven days to reach Parma, who at once\r\n",
      "began to mobilize his invasion forces. The next messenger, however, took five days\r\n",

      "Evidence concerning the ships assembled to carry the troops is more equivocal.\r\n",
      "As Sir William Winter, with a lifetime of naval experience behind him, observed:\r\n",
      "Whereas it is said that the prince {of Parma}’s strength is 30,000 soldiers, then\r\n",
      "I assure your honour it is no mean quantity of shipping that must serve for the\r\n",
      "transporting of that number and that which doth appertaine to them, without\r\n",
      "the which I do not think they will put forth; 300 sail must be the least; and,\r\n",
      "one with another, to be counted 60 ton.^‘\r\n",
      "At first, Parma possessed nothing like this total. Indeed his initial plan of April\r\n",
      "1586 had devoted little attention to marine matters: he wrote vaguely of using\r\n",
      "barges without specifying either numbers or size, and ministers in Madrid had to\r\n",
      "ascertain these details from the messenger who brought the plan to Court. Then\r\n",
      "in November 1587 the duke nonchalantly suggested that the barges - on which\r\n",
      "the success of the whole plan now depended — might not be capable of sailing to\r\n",
      "England after all: ‘I am not convinced that the barges can perform the service that\r\n",
      "we expect of them because, although they sail the seas, they are light and small\r\n",

      "238\r\n",

      "of his troops overland contrasted sharply with his casual attitude towards the far\r\n",
      "more complex task of transporting them across the Channel to England.^^\r\n",
      "Eventually, however, a flotilla of suitable size took shape. Undoubtedly the\r\n",
      "duke exaggerated when he claimed in the autumn of 1587 that he had enough\r\n",
      "ships for the crossing: according to his own records, only 67 vessels then lay in\r\n",
      "Dunkirk harbour, and they lacked 370 guns and 1,630 sailors.\"*^ By June 1588,\r\n",
      "however, an English spy reported some 70 merchant ships of between 50 and 60\r\n",
      "tons’ burthen embargoed in Dunkirk ‘and most of them now laden with vitayle’.\r\n",
      "In addition, ‘There be at Dunkirk twelve great ships of seven or eight score\r\n",

      "between 40 and 50 tons’ burthen, five of them armed with six pieces and the rest\r\n",

      "According to the records of the Flanders fleet itself, by the summer of 1588\r\n",
      "almost 100 vessels — 26 warships (several displacing over 150 tons), 21 barges,\r\n",
      "together with perhaps 50 merchant ships - some hired in Hamburg - rode in\r\n",
      "Dunkirk harbour. Almost 200 more boats, most of them barges, waited in and\r\n",
      "around Nieuwpoort.\"*^ As soon as he heard of the Armada’s departure from Lisbon,\r\n",
      "Parma ordered all seamen to report to their ships upon pain of death, and a week\r\n",
      "later (according to an English source) he ‘came to Dunkirke and viewed the fleete,\r\n",
      "and rowed out of the mouth of the haven to viewe it’.^*’\r\n",
      "A number of experienced English seamen thus seemed convinced that Parma’s\r\n",
      "fleet lay more or less ready to sail by July 1588. Dutch observers agreed: on 14\r\n",
      "July, on the basis of detailed reports, the States of Zeeland concluded that Parma’s\r\n",
      "forces stood ready to embark for any destination he chose: ‘with his ships in such\r\n",
      "readiness that they could set sail in 10 to 12 days’.On 7 August Parma\r\n",
      "apparently wrote to tell Medina (as he later told the king) that his forces would be\r\n",
      "ready to put to sea in just two more days.^^ Some Spanish eyewitnesses, however,\r\n",

      "German regiments scheduled to embark at Nieuwpoort and a member of Parma’s\r\n",

      "true that the magazines of Dunkirk and Nieuwpoort contained large quantities of\r\n",
      "provisions and munitions, with the rest of the equipment and gear that had been\r\n",
      "prepared, they were not embarked; nor were many ships equipped as they should\r\n",

      "as an eyewitness, it was rash to hazard such a powerful army in weak and\r\n",
      "defenceless vessels like those prepared by Parma.’’^ Don Carlos Coloma, a subaltern\r\n",
      "at Dunkirk m 1588, subsequently penned an equally damning verdict in his\r\n",
      "memoirs: ‘Whatever its cause, it is certain - and I saw for myself - that during\r\n",
      "this time [the summer of 1588} the preparation of the fleet in Dunkirk proceeded\r\n",
      "very slowly, so that when it was necessary to embark the Spanish infantry, not\r\n",
      "even the flagship ... was ready to sail.’ Nevertheless, Coloma continued, as soon\r\n",
      "as Parma heard that the Armada had reached Calais,\r\n",
      "He resolved to embark, notwithstanding all other considerations and all\r\n",
      "dangers. The sergeant-majors of the tercios immediately distributed the embarkation\r\n",
      "orders, which were obeyed at once, albeit with much laughter among\r\n",
      "the soldiers \\aunque con harta risa de los soldados^ because many of them were\r\n",
      "required to embark in ships on which no shipwright or ship’s carpenter had\r\n",
      "worked. They were without munitions, without provisions, without sails.\r\n",
      "The patent disparity between these assessments and those of the English and\r\n",
      "Dutch spies is at first sight hard to reconcile. To begin with, however, the\r\n",
      "incompleteness of Parma s flagship, upon which several Spanish observers commented,\r\n",
      "can be discounted: Alonso Vazquez specifically stated that it lacked only\r\n",
      "some of Its cageworks and a lick of gold paint, adding that many a ship had lost\r\n",
      "more of its superstructure in a storm and still successfully completed its journey.\r\n",
      "The charge that other vessels lacked provisions and sails was likewise refuted not\r\n",
      "only by Vazquez but also by another contemporary, Antonio Carnero: ‘I know\r\n",
      "from trustworthy persons who were both present and involved, that only two or\r\n",
      "three ships were not ready.’ Carnero continued:\r\n",
      "Those who say that victuals were lacking are wrong, because a vast quantity of\r\n",
      "baked bread, biscuit, herring and flour was ready to be sent wherever the army\r\n",
      "might be. It was not embarked since it was not necessary to do so, [both}\r\n",
      "because the troops were to cross in a single tide of six hours, in which time few\r\n",
      "provisions would be consumed, and because special boats were designated to\r\n",
      "take the victuals as soon as the troops were aboard.”\r\n",
      "Perhaps, for a relatively short journey, troops could even be crammed aboard boats\r\n",
      "‘like sardines’ - as occurred for a later celebrated cross-Channel expedition from\r\n",
      "Dunkirk, in 1940, as well as in other amphibious operations by the Army of\r\n",

      "Some soldiers complained that they\r\n",
      "were crushed into the appointed\r\n",

      "anticipated that the Channel\r\n",
      "crossing would only take between\r\n",
      "eight and twelve hours, so that on\r\n",
      "the one hand few provisions would\r\n",
      "be needed for the actual journey\r\n",

      "The records of the Flanders fleet itself reveal a stream of payments for preparing\r\n",
      "the ships, right down to painting their names in gold, and adding a sea-horse\r\n",
      "at the prow. Parma’s flagship had a ‘royal standard’ of red damask bearing the\r\n",
      "Spanish coat of arms on one side and a depiction of Christ crucified, flanked by the\r\n",
      "Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist, on the other; other ships would fly ensigns\r\n",
      "of yellow taffeta displaying the cross of Burgundy (also shown in Plate 30), the\r\n",
      "arms of the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands, and of Spain. The flags were\r\n",
      "all ‘scattered with flames of fire’, as a sign that they would be unfurled in war;\r\n",

      "‘sett up their ensignes in the shippes wherein they were to embarke’ in readiness.\r\n",
      "Parma also made his own preparations: in May 1588 his personal treasurer\r\n",
      "purchased the materials to make a special ‘rain cape for His Highness, decorated\r\n",
      "with silver thread’.^\"*\r\n",
      "The balance of opinion on the readiness of the ships thus also favours Parma —\r\n",
      "not least because the criticisms of unpreparedness came mainly from those who\r\n",
      "Was Parma Ready? 241\r\n",
      "recorded their recollections later (Vazcjuez and Coloma) and entirely from\r\n",
      "landsmen with limited experience of how swiftly a vessel could be made seaworthy.\r\n",
      "No doubt some ships did indeed remain unready on 8 August 1588, but\r\n",
      "the majority must have been prepared because, on the one hand, so many Dutch\r\n",
      "and English sailors deemed them to be so and, on the other, the embarkation of\r\n",
      "almost the entire invasion force actually took place. If serious problems had arisen\r\n",
      "in this area, Don Jorge Manrique and other well-placed observers would surely\r\n",
      "have mentioned them in their detailed reports to the king.^^\r\n",
      "Once again, it is easy to forget how many obstacles had been overcome in order\r\n",
      "to create this invasion fleet at Dunkirk and Nieuwpoort. To begin with, Parma\r\n",
      "had originally envisaged launching the invasion of England from Antwerp, where\r\n",
      "he had captured the seventy or so armed vessels (some of them large) that defended\r\n",
      "the city during the siege of 1584-85. Although the Dutch continued to blockade\r\n",
      "the River Scheldt, the duke hoped to be able to bring out a fleet led by his\r\n",
      "flagship, the galleon Sant Alessandro of some 600 tons’ displacement (armed with\r\n",
      "fifty bronze guns) and a large galley (specially built by a team of carpenters\r\n",
      "brought from Genoa), together with some thirty other warships (including eight\r\n",
      "new ‘flyboats’), and various troop transports. Opinions on their value differed.\r\n",
      "One English intelligence report early in 1588 ranked the ‘31 brave ships of war’\r\n",
      "riding before Antwerp as good as any on our side , whereas according to another,\r\n",
      "it is a common opinion that she fParma s flagship} will never be able to brook the\r\n",
      "sea before she be new made fi.e. totally rebuilt}. The rest are ordinary poor\r\n",
      "things’.'^\r\n",
      "Whatever their effectiveness, however, everything depended upon getting the\r\n",
      "Sant Alessandro and her consorts out of the Scheldt. Parma’s capture in August\r\n",
      "1587 of the port of Sluis at the mouth of the estuary, containing a considerable\r\n",
      "number of additional seagoing vessels, opened up the possibility of the big ships\r\n",
      "sailing down the Scheldt, where they would ‘liberate’ the flotilla confined in Sluis\r\n",
      "before proceeding to Nieuwpoort and Dunkirk to embark the invasion army.\r\n",
      "Parma carried out a personal reconnaissance of the estuaries and channels along\r\n",
      "the north coast of Flanders but found that between 130 and 140 Dutch ships lay\r\n",
      "in wait just below Antwerp to forestall precisely this manoeuvre. He reluctantly\r\n",
      "concluded that none of the Antwerp ships could reach Sluis in safety by that route.\r\n",
      "Resourceful as ever, the duke decided to leave the larger warships where they lay,\r\n",
      "in order to pin down the Dutch blockaders, and move the rest to Sluis along the\r\n",
      "inland waterways. Pioneers worked to deepen the canals and to break some dikes\r\n",
      "in order to increase both the level and the flow of water until in March 1588 all\r\n",
      "the smaller craft from Antwerp and other ports along the Scheldt moved to\r\n",
      "Ghent. Thence over 100 ships (including the large galley) eventually reached\r\n",
      "Sluis. At the same time, some 200 seamen recruited in Hamburg and Liibeck\r\n",
      "arrived overland to reinforce the crews aboard the flotilla.^^\r\n",
      "Inevitably the Dutch noticed these developments and almost immediately\r\n",
      "placed another blockade squadron before Sluis, ruling out any thought of a sortie\r\n",
      "from there too. So Parma set his pioneers to work again, this time to deepen the\r\n",

      "All in all it was a most impressive achievement. Against heavy odds, by the\r\n",

      "This total must be put in perspective. Sir William Winter, as already noted,\r\n",
      "thought that 30,000 men and their provisions would require 300 ships with an\r\n",
      "average displacement of 90 tons, or 27,000 tons in all. Parma seems to have met\r\n",
      "that target. Perhaps, however. Winter underestimated: after all, the Dutch assembled\r\n",
      "no fewer than 1,450 vessels for their surprise seaborne attack on Flanders in\r\n",
      "1600, a total displacement of over 150,000 tons for the lOO-kilometre journey of\r\n",
      "their 18,000 troops. Even so, small ships predominated, many of exactly the same\r\n",
      "type (barges normally used on inland waterways) as those assembled by Parma;\r\n",
      "only sixteen warships accompanied the Dutch expedition.Furthermore the\r\n",
      "records of the port of Dunkirk reveal that local merchants at this time frequently\r\n",
      "used ships built for inland use for trade with Dover and the Downs.The\r\n",
      "available data thus fully confirm Parma’s claim that his ships, both at Dunkirk\r\n",
      "and at Nieuwpoort, were ‘ready enough’ for embarkation: on a purely technical\r\n",
      "level, if the Dutch could effect a seaborne invasion with barges in 1600, and if\r\n",
      "Dunkirkers could sail them to England for trade, Parma could also use them to\r\n",
      "carry his army across the Channel.\r\n",
      "As soon as Philip s decision to invade England became public knowledge, Parma\r\n",
      "recognized that his forces would be unable to cross to England in safety until the\r\n",

      "According to a description of the ports specially prepared in 1583 for Philip,\r\n",

      "high tide, with five and almost six respectively at Nieuwpoort, and about one\r\n",

      "during the battle itself, the English sank one Spanish ship by gunfire and inflicted\r\n",
      "such extensive damage on two more, both powerful Portuguese galleons, that they\r\n",

      "shores even against, in the words of Sir John Hawkins, ‘the greatest and strongest\r\n",
      "combination, to my understanding, that ever was gathered in Christendom’?^\r\n",
      "Certain elements of the explanation stemmed from the common heritage of all\r\n",
      "sixteenth-century Atlantic states. By 1500 the ‘full-rigged ship’ — one of the\r\n",
      "greatest technological inventions of medieval Europe, originating in the Iberian\r\n",
      "peninsula and spreading northwards in the course of the fifteenth century — had\r\n",
      "become the most important sailing vessel all along the Atlantic coast. With its\r\n",
      "great holds, it served the needs of the burgeoning European economy; with its\r\n",
      "superb sailing qualities, it facilitated voyages of discovery and overseas colonization;\r\n",
      "with its powerful construction, capable of absorbing the recoil of outgoing\r\n",
      "gunfire as well as the impact of incoming rounds, it opened the way for the\r\n",
      "artillery broadside.\r\n",
      "An effective cannonade, however, also required the invention of hinged\r\n",
      "gunports in the hull, for heavy artillery could be safely deployed only on a ship’s\r\n",
      "lower decks. Although visual evidence reveals the existence of gunports as early as\r\n",
      "the 1470s, the first sailing warships capable of firing ‘great ordnance’ only\r\n",
      "appeared after 1500. During the first two decades of the sixteenth century,\r\n",
      "England, Scotland, France and Denmark all began to build vessels displacing\r\n",
      "around 1,500 tons and heavily armed with gunpowder weapons, some of them\r\n",
      "large. The size and armament of the English fleet rose particularly swiftly: by the\r\n",
      "1540s the ‘Navy Royall’ comprised 53 vessels, including 15 ‘great ships’, with a\r\n",
      "total displacement of some 15,000 tons and almost 200 heavy guns (9-pounder\r\n",
      "calibre and above).^\r\n",
      "Fifty years later the picture had changed in several significant respects. In\r\n",
      "1595, although the Royal Navy included only 38 fighting ships, 23 of them\r\n",
      "exceeded 400 tons’ displacement, and the total for the fleet approached 20,000\r\n",
      "tons.^ More striking still, the total of heavy guns aboard the ships had more than\r\n",
      "tripled — to over 600 — and 250 of them fired a ball weighing 16 pounds or more.\r\n",
      "All these weapons could inflict devastating damage at close quarters.Furthermore\r\n",
      "the ships that bore them possessed a remarkable consistency of construction.\r\n",
      "Beginning in 1573 the queen’s shipwrights introduced a new design — known as\r\n",
      "‘race-built’ — that involved a reduction in the ‘castles’ fore and aft, sleeker lines,\r\n",
      "and a longer gundeck. These changes produced two important advantages: they\r\n",
      "effected a revolution in armament, for the castles had carried the majority of the\r\n",
      "anti-personnel weapons, while the longer gundecks permitted a significant\r\n",
      "increase in the weight of the broadside; and the sleeker lines gave the English\r\n",
      "warships a distinct edge over their competitors, allowing them to sail faster and\r\n",
      "to manoeuvre — and bring their guns to bear — with (for that age) remarkable\r\n",
      "dexterity. The first of the faster ‘all-big-gun battleships’ of the Tudor navy was\r\n",
      "called (in an uncanny parallel with the similarly innovative capital ship of the\r\n",
      "Edwardian navy in the early twentieth century) the Dreadnought. Launched in\r\n",
      "1573, she displaced 700 tons and carried 31 tons of ordnance (not counting the\r\n",
      "weight of the gun carriages and tackles).The ability to carry heavy artillery\r\n",
      "equivalent to almost 5 per cent of total displacement was unprecedented, but this\r\n",
      "record did not last: in 1590 the new ship Defiance, also 700 tons, carried 53 tons\r\n",
      "of ordnance, equivalent to over 7.5 per cent of her displacement. Equally important,\r\n",
      "a remarkable programme of rotation for the queen’s ships began in 1577, to\r\n",
      "‘reform’ (in the phrase of its mastermind. Sir John Hawkins) older vessels to a\r\n",
      "‘race-built’ design: in 1592 the ‘reformed’ Swiftsure (650 tons) bore 43 tons of\r\n",
      "ordnance, or almost 7 per cent of her displacement (see Figure 3).'^\r\n",

      "Why could the Armada not follow suit? After all, the technique of long-range\r\n",

      "1500 by King Manuel of Portugal (Philip’s grandfather) to the commander of\r\n",
      "a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean specified that, upon meeting any hostile\r\n",
      "ships, ‘you are not to come to close quarters with them if you can avoid it, but only\r\n",
      "with your artillery are you to compel them to strike sail ... so that this war may\r\n",
      "be waged with greater safety, and so that less loss may result to the people of your\r\n",
      "ships’.The precision of the orders suggests that the tactics described were not\r\n",
      "new in 1500. Over the next half-century, however, Portuguese tactical doctrine\r\n",
      "for war at sea changed. In 1555 Fernando Oliveira, in his influential treatise The\r\n",
      "art of war at sea (the first manual of naval warfare ever published), still asserted that\r\n",
      "‘at sea we fight at a distance, as if from walls or fortresses, and we seldom come\r\n",
      "close enough to fight hand-to-hand’ and recommended ‘a single and straight\r\n",
      "\\singella e dereytd\\ line’ as the ideal combat formation. But he also advised captains\r\n",
      "to carry heavy weapons only at the prow, like a galley, with lighter pieces, mostly\r\n",
      "muzzle-loaders, on the broadside, and warned that: ‘It is never safe at sea to allow\r\n",
      "opponents on your beam; rather you should always keep them ahead when you are\r\n",
      "fighting . . . Never expose your broadside to them.’^^\r\n",
      "For Oliveira, the ‘single and straight’ line of warships resembled an advancing\r\n",
      "formation of galleys, with their heavy guns to the fore. Theorists of naval warfare\r\n",
      "in Spain agreed. Writing in about 1540, Alonso de Chaves expressly advised\r\n",
      "battle fleets ‘to sail in wings \\en alaf because all [the ships} can see their enemies\r\n",
      "and fire their artillery without impeding each other. They must not sail in line \\en\r\n",
      "hila'l, with one behind the other, because that would cause serious harm, since\r\n",
      "only the ships in the van can fight’.In the 1580s Spain’s Atlantic fleet clearly\r\n",
      "still deployed in a crescent, just like galleys, so that all except the ships on each\r\n",
      "wing (or ‘horn’ as the Spaniards now called it) could normally fire only their\r\n",
      "bow- and stern-chasers.^*’Nevertheless, like galleys, a crescent of sailing warships\r\n",
      "could still inflict grievous harm on an adversary. Thus, in July 1582, a large\r\n",
      "Spanish fleet — including some of the same ships and the same officers who later\r\n",
      "sailed against England — defeated a superior French and English naval force in a\r\n",
      "battle off Sao Miguel in the Azores largely through firepower. The senior Spanish\r\n",
      "infantry officer (a veteran of Lepanto) considered that the battle had been fought\r\n",
      "258 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "‘with the greatest fury ever seen’ and several participants commented on the\r\n",
      "large number of rounds exchanged; one of the principal galleons involved had\r\n",
      "only a single barrel of powder left at the end of the action. According to one\r\n",

      "So Philip’s ships could, on occasion, deploy their artillery effectively and cause\r\n",
      "damage to their foes, yet they did not do so in 1588. The problem does not seem\r\n",
      "to have been a failure to fire. It is possible to be fairly precise about this because\r\n",
      "the clerk aboard every hired ship received strict instructions to keep a record of\r\n",

      "Sidonia’s 48-gun flagship, the San Martin fired 120 rounds on 31 July, 120 again\r\n",
      "on 2 August (‘of which some must have caused much damage to the enemy’s\r\n",
      "ships’), 130 on 3 August and 300 on 8 August.^^ Medina Sidonia’s special envoy\r\n",
      "to the king, Don Balthasar de Zuniga, claimed that after the battle off Gravelines\r\n",
      "‘they had no ammunition left, not even two roundshot with which to withstand\r\n",
      "the enemy’; and the duke himself asserted that by then the fleet ‘had no artillery\r\n",
      "balls to fire’.^’ But this could not have been entirely correct, because all of the nine\r\n",
      "ships for which full information survives (see Figure 5) possessed copious supplies\r\n",
      "of both powder and shot long after 8 August and the same seems to have been true\r\n",
      "of others. Medina Sidonia himself provides a crucial clue, for on 4 August he\r\n",
      "begged the duke of Parma to send him ‘a couple of ships with powder and shot of\r\n",
      "the calibre specified in the memorial attached’. That memorial has apparently not\r\n",
      "survived but, according to Medina’s campaign journal, he asked Parma for ‘balls\r\n",
      "of 4, 6 and 10 pounds, because many of them had been expended during the\r\n",
      "skirmishes’.^^Likewise the surviving records — both archaeological and archival —\r\n",
      "of the various Spanish ships reveal that they fired mostly small shot, even though\r\n",
      "only larger-calibre ammunition stood much chance of inflicting serious damage\r\n",
      "on Elizabeth’s ships. Thus of the 314 iron shot fired during the 1588 campaign by\r\n",

      "exception: Philip IPs clerks noted the issue of shot and other munitions to vessels hired from the private sector\r\n",
      "but not for the crown’s own vessels, whereas the queen’s servants appear to have done exactly the reverse. No\r\n",
      "account apparently survives on the gunnery performance of the galleons of Portugal or Castile, which by\r\n",

      "issued, but also the number fired day by day and the quantity returned to government store when the fleet got\r\n",

      "historians have noted that the English government’s own ‘Dockyard Survey’ of the\r\n",
      "queen’s ships recorded only damage to sails, rigging, masts, boats and superstructures\r\n",
      "— and precious little of that — with not a single mention of structural damage\r\n",
      "to hulls.This should occasion no surprise, because responsibility for repairing\r\n",
      "the hulls of the queen’s ships lay with the treasurer of the navy, not with the\r\n",
      "dockyards, and his accounts for the year 1588 show substantial expenditure on\r\n",
      "‘the groundinge, gravinge, repairinge and preparinge at Chatham of all her\r\n",
      "highnes’ ships’ after the Armada campaign. These structural repairs required over\r\n",
      "4,000 metres of planking (ranging from 2 to 9 centimetres thick); 99,500 nails\r\n",
      "and 1,000 treenails; 15,400 pounds of ironwork; 85 loads of oak and elm timber;\r\n",
      "and wages for 948 ‘shipwrights, sawyers and pulleymakers’ who worked an\r\n",
      "average of 35 days each.This total is the largest repair bill found in any of the\r\n",
      "accounts submitted by the treasurers of the navy during the entire period of\r\n",
      "the Spanish War, and it indicates that Elizabeth’s warships returned to port after\r\n",
      "the Armada campaign in need of considerable repair.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, these figures must be placed in perspective. First, the total cost\r\n",
      "only ran to £3,500 (about 14,000 ducats) — the amount required to build or repair\r\n",
      "just one new warship — in a record expenditure for the year of over £92,000\r\n",
      "(roughly 368,000 ducats).Second, although the account provides no detail about\r\n",
      "which ships received what repairs, something about the scale and nature of the\r\n",
      "operation can be deduced from the materials supplied. The majority of the\r\n",
      "planking was 2 and 4 centimetres (some 3,000 metres), which can only have\r\n",
      "served for the superstructures; the 500 metres of 6-centimetre planks probably\r\n",
      "went into internal decks; but repairs to the ships’ hulls would have required 8-\r\n",
      "centimetre planking, and of this less than 200 metres were purchased. Likewise\r\n",
      "the large number of iron nails would have gone into the superstructures, because\r\n",
      "fastening the hull required treenails — of which only 1,000 were supplied. Third,\r\n",
      "85 loads (roughly 85 tons) of timber would not go far, since constructing an\r\n",
      "Elizabethan galleon required at least 500 loads. Furthermore, the same account\r\n",
      "reveals that far more repairs took place before the campaign against the Armada.\r\n",
      "Early in 1588, just for Howard’s squadron, contractors supplied almost 8,000\r\n",
      "metres of planking (over 1,000 metres of it 8-centimetre), 9,000 treenails, 56\r\n",
      "‘great beams’, and 262 loads of oak, elm and maple.In view of all this it seems\r\n",
      "safe to affirm that Philip’s ships failed to inflict serious damage on their adversaries\r\n",
      "in 1588, even though during the engagement on 8 August (at least) some of\r\n",
      "them had fired repeated artillery salvoes at very close quarters (‘within speech of\r\n",
      "one another’. Why?\r\n",
      "Recent attempts to explain this failure have centred on three technological\r\n",
      "issues: the larger size, the poor performance, and the inferior gunnery of the\r\n",
      "Spanish vessels. There is less to these charges than meets the eye. The debate on\r\n",
      "the relative size of the ships stems largely from the different (and somewhat\r\n",
      "arcane) systems of measuring vessels at the time; for contemporaries the contrast\r\n",
      "seemed less significant. Thus in 1586 four Portuguese captains captured and\r\n",
      "interviewed by John Hawkins compared one of the queen’s ships — the Hope — with\r\n",
      "the flagship of the Portuguese squadron: ‘it was only slightly smaller than the\r\n",
      "galleon San Martin,' they said, and a comparison of displacements, rather than\r\n",
      "capacity, confirms this.\"*^ However, whatever the size, observers on both sides\r\n",
      "a6o The Execution of Grand Strategy The Guns of August 261\r\n",
      "agreed that English ‘race-built’ galleons, both royal and private, could manoeuvre\r\n",
      "far more rapidly than their adversaries. Don Diego Pimentel claimed that\r\n",
      "the English had been ‘able to tack four or five times in the time it took us to go\r\n",
      "about once’; while, according to another senior officer, in comparison with some\r\n",
      "of their English adversaries, even the swiftest ship in the Armada ‘appeared to\r\n",
      "be standing still’Moreover, many of Philip’s vessels probably did exceed the\r\n",
      "queen’s ships in size, because they were bulk cargo vessels: after all, one of the\r\n",
      "Armada’s primary functions was to transport the munitions, equipment and\r\n",
      "reinforcements that Parma required for a successful invasion; Elizabeth’s fleet\r\n",
      "simply had to fight.\r\n",
      "The evidence concerning gunnery is more complicated. To begin with, even the\r\n",
      "galleons of Portugal carried a mixed bag of weaponry. Thus the i ,ooo-ton San\r\n",
      "Juan on which Recalde sailed, built in 1586 and reputed ‘the best-gunned ship jn\r\n",
      "the Armada’ because ‘her artillery was the most uniform in type and weight, being\r\n",
      "armed with guns made for the purpose’, nevertheless carried nothing larger than\r\n",
      "a 2o-pounder, with eight more pieces throwing between 16- and 18-pound shot.\r\n",
      "Most of the other big guns were periers (stone-throwers), and the majority of the\r\n",
      "San Juans 46 guns fired 10 pound balls or less. Moreover (despite the paean to\r\n",
      "uniformity) her ordnance consisted of no fewer than nine different calibres of iron\r\n",
      "and six more of stone shot. Among the flagships of other squadrons, the i ,ioo-ton\r\n",
      "Santa Ana (Guipuzcoa) carried 47 guns, but only three fired 16-pound balls or\r\n",
      "more; the i,ooo-ton Nuestra Senora del Rosario (Andalusia) carried 46 guns, of\r\n",
      "which nine threw 16-pound balls or more; and the 6oo-ton San Cristobal (Castile)\r\n",
      "carried 32 guns, the largest two 12-pounder periers.In fact the entire Armada\r\n",
      "lacked heavy artillery: fewer than 150 of the 2,431 guns known to be aboard the\r\n",
      "fleet fired 16-pound shot and above, and these belonged to at least twelve different\r\n",
      "calibres, the heaviest of them siege pieces unsuitable for use at sea. The Royal\r\n",
      "Navy, by contrast, boasted 250 heavy guns, all belonging to the same three\r\n",
      "calibres.\r\n",
      "Many other guns on the Spanish Armada may also have been ill-suited for use\r\n",
      "at sea because they rested upon two-wheel carriages with long trails, whereas the\r\n",
      "queen’s ships (at least) used compact four-wheel carriages. Even the first known\r\n",
      "survey of the Royal Navy, in 1515, recorded that the large guns aboard Henry\r\n",
      "VIII’s warships rested on ‘trotills’ or ‘on four wheels’; and examples of such\r\n",
      "carriages have been excavated from the wreck of the Mary Rose, one of those\r\n",
      "very ships, which sank thirty years later. By the 1570s, when systematic records\r\n",
      "begin to survive, the Ordnance Office constructed ‘carriages for sea service’\r\n",
      "with ‘truckells’ quite differently, and kept them quite separately, from ‘land\r\n",
      "carriages’.\"*^ This does not seem to have been the case on the Spanish ships. Some\r\n",
      "guns aboard the Armada were definitely mounted upon very large two-wheeled\r\n",
      "carriages, some of them expressly intended for land use. Thus in April 1588 Don\r\n",
      "Pedro de Valdes, commander of the Andalusian squadron, noted that ‘The hulk\r\n",
      "named Santa Ana has a culverin of 31 quintals and 93 pounds of Naples which,\r\n",
      "because it is very long and is on a land carriage, cannot be used on the said hulk\r\n",
      "262 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "because there is not sufficient space for it.’ Valdes therefore ordered the gun to be\r\n",
      "brought aboard his own, much larger, flagship, Nuestra Senora del Rosario, together\r\n",
      "with 30 rounds and appropriate loading equipment.^'^ Excavation of the Trinidad\r\n",
      "Valencera, a Venetian transport embargoed for service with the Armada and\r\n",
      "wrecked on the coast of Northern Ireland, revealed a massive sea-carriage with a\r\n",
      "long trail, making an assemblage 6 metres long on a deck barely 12 metres wide.^^\r\n",
      "Whether these inappropriate mountings prevailed throughout the fleet is not\r\n",
      "known, because so far only details of new carriages supplied to the Andalusian\r\n",
      "squadron have been founds but those had only two wheels, each apparently\r\n",
      "standing 72 centimetres high.\"**^\r\n",
      "One last technical factor may have influenced the outcome of the Armada\r\n",
      "campaign. Many Spanish vessels had fewer gunners than the queen’s ships they\r\n",
      "faced - although only incomplete statistics survive on each side. Thus the number\r\n",
      "of gunners aboard Elizabeth’s warships varied between twenty and forty, while\r\n",
      "those aboard the ships of the Armada’s Andalusian squadron rarely exceeded ten.'*^\r\n",
      "The former, moreover, were purpose-built warships, the latter merchantmen\r\n",
      "embargoed as they prepared to sail to America; and in any case, writing some years\r\n",
      "later. Sir W^alter Raleigh held that every piece at least requires foure gunners to\r\n",
      "attend it Admittedly Alonso Vanegas, a gunnery officer aboard the Spanish\r\n",
      "flagship, claimed that a gun captain and his assistant, with six soldiers, served\r\n",
      "each piece aboard the San Martin, under the overall command of a master gunner\r\n",
      "{condestable) and six artillery officers; while Medina Sidonia’s battle orders for his\r\n",
      "ship allocated two artillery officers to each side of the main gundeck, and a senior\r\n",
      "officer with four assistants (two on each side) on the other.^' However, as Colin\r\n",
      "Martin has pointed out, if six soldiers permanently worked each of the flagship’s\r\n",
      "48 guns, no fewer than 288 of the 302 soldiers aboard would have been tied down.\r\n",
      "Furthermore, Medina Sidonia s battle orders also stipulated that, once at action\r\n",
      "stations, all soldiers would serve as infantry, fully armed for combat, with\r\n",
      "muskets, arquebuses and slow match at the ready; they could hardly then double\r\n",
      "up as gunners. Elizabeth s captains, by contrast, expected everyone — gentlemen,\r\n",
      "gunners, sailors — to participate equally in any activity required.\r\n",
      "Technology, however, cannot entirely explain the unequal performance of the\r\n",
      "two fleets in August 1588. Commanders on both sides reckoned that some twenty\r\n",
      "vessels in each fleet bore the brunt of the action, fighting as well as they could,\r\n",
      "while the rest tried to keep out of trouble. Moreover the armament (like the size)\r\n",
      "of those twenty vessels perhaps did not differ greatly: the San Salvador and the\r\n",
      "Rosario, although they played no part in the action, carried several guns that their\r\n",
      "English captors reckoned as cannon, culverin and demi-culverin. The real issue, as\r\n",
      "noted above, was not how many big guns the Armada carried, but how often and\r\n",
      "how effectively they fired them.”\r\n",
      "Philip had not assembled his fleet with a view to fighting and winning a closerange\r\n",
      "naval duel as a prelude to landing an invincible expeditionary force: rather,\r\n",
      "as already noted, his Grand Strategy assigned it the role of an armed convoy that\r\n",
      "would transport supplies and reinforcements to the rendezvous with Parma’s\r\n",
      "army. The king’s instructions to the fleet commanders - first Santa Cruz and then\r\n",
      "Medina Sidonia - stressed that battle should be avoided at almost any cost.\r\n",
      "Since the success of this business consists of going for the root, even if Drake\r\n",
      "should have set out for these waters with a fleet in order to divert and hinder\r\n",
      "{you}, as some reports from England claim, you are not to be deflected from\r\n",
      "your journey, but rather continue it without seeking out the enemy.\r\n",
      "Admittedly the king allowed three exceptions:\r\n",
      "If [Drake] follows you and comes close, you may in that case attack; and also if\r\n",
      "you run into Drake and his fleet at the mouth of the Channel, because if the\r\n",
      "[English] forces are divided, it would be very good to defeat them in this way\r\n",
      "so that they cannot unite.\r\n",
      "And if, finally, the Armada reached the Narrow Seas and found Elizabeth’s entire\r\n",
      "navy defending the coast, then - and only then - Medina was permitted to attack.\r\n",
      "Philip’s advice on how to win in these circumstances did not correspond to\r\n",
      "reality, however, and he offered no advice on how exactly Medina should force the\r\n",
      "English to come close enough to be boarded.^^ In 1587, Philip had prudently\r\n",
      "allowed Santa Cruz a measure of latitude to disregard his tactical instructions if\r\n",
      "necessary:\r\n",
      "Since the outcome of wars, and especially of wars at sea, are so subject to\r\n",
      "fluctuations in the weather and to the uncertainty of the information available\r\n",
      "to those who command armies and navies, I have absolutely nothing certain to\r\n",
      "tell you or precise orders to give concerning what should be done with the fleet.\r\n",
      "Since you are so competent and expert in both, it seemed best to delegate all\r\n",
      "this to you so that, according to the opportunities that occur, both for the navy\r\n",
      "to fight and for the pursuit of the pirates [i.e. the English], and in all the other\r\n",
      "things that may occur during your voyage, you will do whatever seems to you\r\n",
      "most appropriate. ”\r\n",
      "In 1588, however, Medina received no such dispensation. Instead Philip personally\r\n",
      "placed at the duke’s right hand a naval adviser renowned for his caution.” At\r\n",
      "first sight, Diego Flores de Valdes possessed impressive credentials for the job. He\r\n",
      "had participated in a peacetime expedition to England in 1554 (bringing Philip\r\n",
      "II from Corunna to Southampton in order to marry Mary Tudor) and served\r\n",
      "as second-in-command of the fleet that in 1565 expelled the French from Florida.\r\n",
      "He had also commanded without mishap the great convoys sailing between Spain\r\n",
      "and the Caribbean eight times between 1567 and 1580. Since the king saw the\r\n",
      "Armada in much the same light, and since Flores’s experience in this regard was\r\n",
      "second to none, his posting to the flagship seems less surprising.” Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "The Guns of August 263\r\n",
      "264 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "his record as commander of the flotilla sent to chase the English from the South\r\n",
      "Atlantic in 1581—84 had been lacklustre and, early in 1588, on hearing of Flores’s\r\n",
      "appointment to command the squadron of Castile, at least one person warned the\r\n",
      "king that he would do better to appoint ‘a man who is not so timid and so afraid\r\n",
      "of fighting’.\r\n",
      "The advice proved prescient, for throughout the Armada campaign Diego\r\n",
      "Flores consistently advocated policies that were ‘timid’ and many subsequently\r\n",
      "blamed him for the failure of the entire enterprise. His critics included the\r\n",
      "Armada’s second-in-command. Admiral Juan Martinez de Recalde, who had more\r\n",
      "combat experience than anyone in either fleet — Spanish or English — since he had\r\n",
      "participated in several naval engagements in the 1570s and in the Terceira\r\n",
      "campaign. He had also commanded two troop convoys sailing from Spain to\r\n",
      "Dunkirk (one of which sheltered for a while in the Solent), as well as an amphibious\r\n",
      "expedition to Smerwick in Ireland.\r\n",
      "Recalde’s strategic vision differed radically from that of both Philip II and\r\n",
      "Diego Flores. On 29 July 1588, even before sighting the English coast, the\r\n",
      "admiral wanted to ‘ensure that the enemy comes out to fight, and to incite him to\r\n",
      "do so’, and he therefore advocated a surprise attack on the port of Plymouth, where\r\n",
      "the English fleet was by then known to be refitting: ‘Although I am no friend\r\n",
      "of bravado, we should try it as we pass before the port {of Plymouth},’ he wrote.\r\n",
      "At a council of war the next day, Recalde and others tried to convince the duke to\r\n",
      "sail straight to Plymouth and there either bottle up or destroy the English fleet:\r\n",
      "according to one witness, the council ‘agreed that yf they could passe the haven\r\n",
      "with twenty shipps abrest they would followe that advise’. That same night\r\n",
      "however — perhaps intentionally — Medina took a decision that prevented this: he\r\n",
      "ordered the Armada to take in sail and wait, allegedly to rally all his fleet. He\r\n",
      "subsequently justified his action (to an irate Recalde) by claiming that although\r\n",
      "the attack on Plymouth ‘was discussed by the council, it was not decided upon,\r\n",
      "nor was it advisable’.This crucial delay gave the English fleet time to get to sea\r\n",
      "and to gain the weather gauge.\r\n",
      "On I August, since the English remained resolutely to windward, Recalde\r\n",
      "urged Medina to turn the Armada around and launch an outright attack, ‘and\r\n",
      "better to do it today than tomorrow, because we are using up our resources while\r\n",
      "our enemies are increasing theirs’. In another note that day he argued vociferously\r\n",
      "for attack again: ‘We should put all our eggs in one basket, and the sooner the\r\n",
      "better’. Yet again, the duke remained faithful to Philip’s Instructions and kept\r\n",
      "sailing up the Channel. On the 4th, Recalde offered to lead the entire rearguard\r\n",
      "of the Armada in pursuit of the English in order either to drive them away or\r\n",
      "confine them in the Solent, the anchorage between the Isle of Wight and the\r\n",
      "English mainland. At the same time he strongly opposed proceeding any further\r\n",
      "up the Channel, where the Armada would lack an adequate anchorage, until the\r\n",
      "duke of Parma confirmed that he knew of the fleet’s approach and had his forces\r\n",
      "ready for the invasion.For the third time Medina Sidonia rejected his admiral’s\r\n",
      "advice.\r\n",
      "Little did Recalde realize that the duke had no choice. In June, as his fleet\r\n",
      "approached Cape Finisterre, Medina forwarded to the king a copy of his letter to\r\n",
      "Parma reporting that he had ‘consulted the pilots and other experts aboard this\r\n",
      "fleet who are familiar with the whole coast of England, and asked them to decide\r\n",
      "in which port this Armada might shelter’ while he waited for news that Parma\r\n",
      "had his forces ready.Philip immediately responded: ‘The main point {of the\r\n",
      "plan} was to go on until you could join hands with the duke my nephew,’ he\r\n",
      "chided. ‘I am sure you will have done this, and proceeded to that location and\r\n",
      "made safe the duke’s transit’. If the campaign had gone according to plan Medina\r\n",
      "would not have received this message until it was too late since the king sent it\r\n",
      "to Flanders for delivery: it would have remained just another of Philip’s misguided\r\n",
      "but ineffective attempts at micromanagement. As it happened, however.\r\n",

      "again to reach Parma.\r\n",

      "This change alone, however, would not have tipped the scales. On the one hand,\r\n",

      "the previous week, there seems no reason to suppose that the outcome would have\r\n",
      "been different.Given the inequality in firepower, boarding offered the Armada’s\r\n",

      "my part I have done everything possible and given them every occasion —\r\n",
      "sometimes our ships have been in the middle of their fleet, all to the end that\r\n",
      "one of their ships should board and so bring on the battle.\r\n",
      "English naval writers agreed on the crucial role of boarding. Sir Walter Raleigh\r\n",
      "later drew attention to the naval battle off Sao Miguel in 1582, at which the\r\n",
      "victory of Philip’s fleet had hung in the balance until one ship managed to grapple\r\n",
      "the enemy flagship and thus brought on a general melee in which boarding could\r\n",
      "take place. Had Howard of Effingham allowed this to happen in 1588, Raleigh\r\n",
      "believed he would have been lost too.^^ It is easy to see why: the Spanish fleet\r\n",
      "carried almost 20,000 soldiers — more than enough to overwhelm all the queen’s\r\n",
      "ships, which carried only sailors and gunners, had the two fleets become entangled.\r\n",
      "Howard and his subordinates fully realized this, which is why they took care\r\n",

      "from more than just tactical skill.\r\n",

      "more artillery than a fortress, and required over a year to construct; even after that,\r\n",
      "it took time to train the officers, gunners and crews for combat. Philip II had\r\n",
      "started late: having maintained a powerful fleet of galleys and galleasses in the\r\n",

      "at Santander to serve as escorts for the American treasure fleets, and between 1583\r\n",
      "and 1586 he had six more large galleons built for the defence of Portugal. Late in\r\n",
      "1587 he authorized a crash programme of cannon-founding at Lisbon — even\r\n",
      "agreeing that the new guns need not bear the royal arms, in order to save time and\r\n",
      "money — although in March 1588 he still feared (rightly, as it turned out) that too\r\n",
      "many of his ships either had too few guns or lacked sufficient guns of heavy\r\n",

      "The king agreed: he continued to restrict his support for the French Catholic cause\r\n",

      "much, especially after the death of his brother Anjou in 1584: his Protestant and\r\n",
      "his Catholic subjects despised and distrusted him in almost equal measure, and\r\n",
      "the royal treasury lay empty. The only scenario that might have seemed preferable\r\n",
      "to Philip would have been Henry’s death, leaving a healthy young son to be\r\n",

      "developments in France:\r\n",
      "My principal aim [there] is to secure the well-being of the Faith, and to see that\r\n",
      "in France Catholicism survives and heresy is excluded ... If, in order to ensure\r\n",
      "this exclusion and to aid the Catholics so that they prevail, you see that it is\r\n",
      "necessary for my troops to enter France openly [then you must lead them in}.\r\n",
      "This would inevitably mean both postponing the surprise attack on the Isle of\r\n",

      "allow it), it seems that we must do something about the war in the Netherlands,\r\n",
      "reducing it to a defensive footing.\r\n",

      "Parma, fearing the strategic dilemma that now threatened to engulf him,\r\n",
      "responded with the suggestion that the king should open peace talks with the\r\n",
      "274 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "Dutch, offering to permit the private exercise of Calvinist worship in certain\r\n",
      "towns of Holland and Zealand for an indefinite period if ‘the rebels’ promised to\r\n",
      "‘return to obedience’ (which he construed as ordering the demobilization of their\r\n",

      "in Madrid debated this peace plan indecisively in November 1589: on the one\r\n",
      "hand, they recognized that to concede toleration to the Dutch would forfeit ‘the\r\n",
      "claim His Majesty has made, and the reputation he has won at the cost of so much\r\n",
      "treasure and so many lives, not to concede one jot or tittle in matters of religion’;\r\n",
      "on the other, they lamented, ‘to attempt to conquer the rebellious provinces by\r\n",
      "force is to speak of a war without end’. The king agreed: he resolved to ask the\r\n",
      "pope either to start contributing directly to the cost of fighting the Dutch (‘since\r\n",
      "this war is being waged solely for religion’) or to permit peace talks to begin. In\r\n",
      "the meantime Parma received authorization to see whether the rebels might be\r\n",
      "willing to negotiate a settlement.\r\n",
      "Yet again, however, new strategic pressures intervened. In February 1590,\r\n",
      "Henry of Navarre’s decision to blockade Paris (the League’s capital since the Day\r\n",
      "of the Barricades, p. 200 above) raised the possibility that unless the French\r\n",
      "Catholics received open and substantial military aid their resistance might collapse.\r\n",
      "The Spanish council of State now debated a number of possible strategies:\r\n",
      "a descent by Parma and the Army of Flanders in the north to relieve Paris; landing\r\n",
      "an expeditionary force from Spain in Brittany in the west; and a thrust by land\r\n",
      "forces from Aragon into Languedoc or Bearn in the south. The council felt that\r\n",
      "one operation would not be enough to save the Catholic cause, whereas three\r\n",
      "would overtax Spain’s resources; they therefore suggested that the fleet destined\r\n",
      "for a new assault on England should instead land troops in Brittany, while the\r\n",

      "Philip informed Parma that ‘the strategy for assisting the French Catholic cause\r\n",
      "that I have followed, although the correct one until now, will not serve any\r\n",
      "longer’. He commanded the duke to invade France at once with 20,000 men.\r\n",
      "They left the Netherlands in late July and entered Paris in triumph in September.\r\n",
      "One month later an expeditionary force of 3,000 men from Spain arrived at St\r\n",
      "Nazaire in Brittany both to reinforce the French Catholics there and to create\r\n",
      "a fortified base for future operations against England.The king saw no alternative\r\n",
      "to these expensive commitments. As he explained to one of his wealthiest\r\n",
      "subjects, as he requested a donation:\r\n",
      "Everybody knows about the great, continuous and unavoidable expenses that I\r\n",
      "have incurred for many years past to defend our holy Catholic faith and to\r\n",
      "conserve my kingdoms and lordships, and how they have grown immensely\r\n",
      "through the war with England and the developments in France; but I have not\r\n",
      "been able to avoid them, both because I have such a specific obligation to God\r\n",

      "and the world to act, and also because if the heretics were to prevail (which I\r\n",
      "hope God will not allow) it might open the door to worse damage and dangers,\r\n",
      "and to war at home.\r\n",
      "At least the king decided to reconsider his position on the Dutch problem:\r\n",
      "in November 1590 he informed the pope that he stood ready to concede\r\n",
      "toleration to his rebels for a limited time in return for recognition of his\r\n",
      "sovereignty, and requested the appointment of papal and imperial intermediaries\r\n",
      "to handle negotiations to secure this. He even hoped for a cease-fire during the\r\n",
      "talks.\r\n",
      "Naturally, he hoped in vain. As in 1576 (see p. 144 above) the king’s decision\r\n",
      "to offer important concessions — made only when he really had no alternative —\r\n",
      "came too late. Although the Dutch went through the motions of negotiating, as\r\n",
      "soon as Parma intervened in France they launched a series of campaigns which\r\n",
      "recovered much of Gelderland and Overijssel in 1591—92. So Philip now found\r\n",
      "himself with not one but three ‘voracious monsters gobbling up the troops and\r\n",
      "treasure of Spain’.In 1591 a fourth appeared: a ham-fisted attempt by the\r\n",
      "government to extradite a fugitive from justice in Zaragoza provoked major\r\n",
      "rioting which turned into open rebellion in September. The following month,\r\n",
      "with remarkable promptitude, a royal army of 14,000 troops invaded Aragon and\r\n",
      "swiftly restored order — but only at a cost of almost 1.5 million ducats, diverted\r\n",
      "from the funds earmarked for Philip’s wars abroad.\r\n",
      "The rapidly worsening strategic position of the Monarchy alarmed the king. In\r\n",
      "January 1591, even before the troubles in Aragon, Philip regretted that the affairs\r\n",
      "of his Monarchy ‘do not depend on my will, or on my wanting it, but rather on\r\n",
      "many other matters that are hard to arrange. Everything is in a terrible state unless\r\n",
      "God remedies it’. The following month Mateo Vazquez warned his master that ‘if\r\n",
      "God had placed Your Majesty under an obligation to remedy all the troubles of\r\n",
      "the world. He would have given you the money and the strength to do so’; while\r\n",
      "in September 1591 Escalante advised that under no circumstances should Spain\r\n",
      "intervene openly in France or use force in Aragon — rather, all available resources\r\n",
      "should remain reserved for operations against England. Escalante compared the\r\n",
      "Anglo-Spanish struggle to that of Rome against Carthage, and argued that\r\n",
      "only a direct attack on England would stop Elizabeth and her subjects from\r\n",
      "supporting the Dutch, ravaging the Indies, and attacking Spanish ports and ships.\r\n",
      "Admittedly, Philip’s decision to intervene openly in France achieved important\r\n",
      "short-term results (without it, the League would almost certainly have collapsed\r\n",
      "in 1592); but now the two sides in the French civil war stood fairly evenly\r\n",
      "matched so that Spain — just as Escalante had predicted — faced the prospect of\r\n",
      "another ‘war without end’ to sustain. In this stressful situation, as in earlier crises,\r\n",
      "the king oscillated between bitter fatalism and messianic euphoria. He may never\r\n",
      "have seen Escalante’s (somewhat verbose) admonition; but to Vazquez he replied\r\n",
      "grandly:\r\n",
      "j.\r\n",
      "276 The Execution of Grand Strategy\r\n",
      "I know you are moved by the great zeal you have for my service to say what you\r\n",
      "did, but you must also understand that these are not matters that can be\r\n",
      "abandoned by a person who is as conscientious about his responsibilities as you\r\n",
      "know me to be.\r\n",
      "‘The cause of religion’, the king concluded, ‘must take precedence over everything’.^^\r\n",
      "Like his Bourbon descendants two centuries later, Philip seemed to have\r\n",
      "learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\r\n",
      "If the principles of Philip’s Grand Strategy remained the same despite the\r\n",
      "Armada’s failure, so did the practice. He continued to rely on God to intervene in\r\n",
      "case Spain’s resources alone proved inadequate. Thus in October 1596 he deployed\r\n",
      "precisely the same arsenal of spiritual blackmail that he had used in the past\r\n",
      "against Alba, Santa Cruz and Medina Sidonia, in order to persuade the dispirited\r\n",
      "commander of his new High Seas fleet to sail immediately against England.\r\n",
      "I tell you again and order you expressly ... to leave in the name of God and do\r\n",
      "what I have ordered in the voyage and in the whole campaign. Although I see\r\n",
      "that the season is advanced, and the risks that this poses, we have to trust in\r\n",
      "God (who has done so much for us) in this. To stop what we have begun now\r\n",
      "would be to show weakness in His service, to spend money without profit, and\r\n",
      "to find ourselves without troops in time of need. Since these are definite\r\n",
      "disadvantages, it would not be sensible to allow them. It is also [our] Christian\r\n",
      "duty to put into effect what we have done and you, in any case, must aid me\r\n",
      "now to achieve it. May God guide you, and I trust in Him that there will be\r\n",
      "much to thank Him — and you — for.^\"*\r\n",
      "Furthermore, the king still permitted no debate over his perception of Spain’s\r\n",
      "strategic needs. When Admiral Bertendona went to Court in June 1589 and\r\n",
      "requested an opportunity to give his sovereign some advice ‘in case there should\r\n",
      "be a campaign against England next year’, Philip characteristically replied: ‘you\r\n",
      "can tell me about it in writing, since there is no opportunity to do it in person’.\r\n",
      "Equally characteristically, shortly afterwards he asked Bertendona to send him\r\n",
      "detailed information on naval affairs, ‘because I would like to be informed of what\r\n",
      "occurs to you for when we take a decision on the matters you raise’.\r\n",
      "Although after the death of Mateo Vazquez in 1591 the volume of Philip’s\r\n",
      "surviving personal papers dwindles dramatically, making it harder to generalize\r\n",
      "about his intentions, nothing suggests a major change in his outlook or his\r\n",
      "priorities. He took some anti-tax riots in Castile and the revolt of Aragon in his\r\n",
      "stride, and when some proctors in the Cortes of Castile protested in 1596 against\r\n",
      "the heavy expenditure on foreign wars, pointing out that ‘although the wars\r\n",
      "against the Dutch, the English and the French are holy and just, we must beg\r\n",
      "Your Majesty that they may cease’, Philip firmly rebuked the representatives of\r\n",
      "the people for their presumption.\r\n",
      "After the Armada 277\r\n",
      "They should and must put their trust in me, in the love I have for these\r\n",
      "kingdoms, and in the long experience I have in governing them, [and accept]\r\n",
      "that I shall always do what is in their best interests. Speak to them at length in\r\n",
      "this vein and advise them that they are never, on any pretext, to come to me\r\n",
      "with such a suggestion again.\r\n",
      "He also took more practical steps to neutralize this opposition: ‘the theologians of\r\n",
      "Madrid should be forewarned’, he wrote, ‘so that if the deputies of the Cortes\r\n",
      "should turn to them for advice, they may include in their opinions a full account\r\n",
      "of my case’ (more sinister, he also expected the theologians to report the intentions\r\n",
      "of their advisees to his agents). The government furthermore ordered theologians\r\n",
      "in the other towns represented in the Cortes ‘to assure the consciences of the\r\n",
      "scrupulous’ and to mobilize support for royal policies both through personal\r\n",
      "meetings and through written (sometimes published) tracts.\r\n",
      "These repeated efforts at spiritual blackmail reflected a perceptible reduction in\r\n",
      "Philip’s ability to get things done. In the early 1590s, every morning he discussed\r\n",
      "financial and domestic business with his chamberlain, Don Cristobal de Moura,\r\n",
      "who also dressed him and massaged his feet; after lunch he handled Italian and\r\n",
      "Aragonese business with the count of Chinchon; and he spent every afternoon and\r\n",
      "evening with his principal secretary of state, Don Juan de Idiaquez, dealing with\r\n",
      "foreign affairs. As the years passed, the king spent more time at prayer, more time\r\n",
      "asleep, and more time sick: illness prevented him from transacting business in\r\n",
      "May and June 1595, in March and April 1596, in spring 1597 and for most of\r\n",
      "1598, the year of his death. After 1595 he spent most of his days in the sixteenthcentury\r\n",
      "equivalent of a wheelchair — a sort of lounger with movable positions from\r\n",
      "vertical to horizontal — in which he ate, worked and slept, wearing loose garments\r\n",
      "that did not put pressure on his arthritic joints (Plate 33). He could not manage\r\n",
      "to stand for the last two years of his life. Although in 1594 he began to make use\r\n",
      "of Prince Philip for routine decisions, and although after 1597 the prince signed\r\n",
      "all outgoing orders, the king relied increasingly on Moura to convey his commands\r\n",
      "to all ortgans of state and his meandering apostils on incoming documents\r\n",

      "they and their overworked associates encountered with increasing frequency the\r\n",

      "to command the governor of Milan to expel the small Jewish community from\r\n",

      "this congruence ‘between God’s service and mine’ no doubt played a part in his\r\n",
      "numerous decisions to go to war. After the failure of that initial effort, however,\r\n",
      "the congruence ceased. In each case, political considerations called for a rapid\r\n",
      "compromise and a negotiated peace; only religious concerns required hostilities to\r\n",

      "wrote in 1586 (with a rare touch of humour) when Sixtus V suggested that Spain\r\n",
      "would have to attack England anyway in order to retaliate against Elizabeth’s\r\n",
      "attacks, whether or not the Papacy helped him to finance it:\r\n",
      "I reject the opinion they have {in Italy} that necessity compels me to undertake\r\n",
      "this enterprise, because although over there they hold the law of vengeance to\r\n",

      "the Atlantic convoys and the Americas, I could avoid embarking on such a\r\n",
      "difficult enterprise because I would be safe and sure of not being open to attack.\r\n",
      "His Holiness really needs to understand that; and also that if I want to\r\n",
      "undertake the venture, properly supported, it is with no other cause or aim\r\n",
      "beyond the sadness I feel to see the persecution that afflicts the church there,\r\n",
      "and the duty that all of us have to serve Our Lord.^^\r\n",
      "Such convictions lay at the root of the king’s remarkable confidence that, whenever\r\n",
      "his plans ran into difficulty, God would ‘return to support His cause’ and\r\n",
      "produce the miracle that would enable him to overcome all obstacles because it\r\n",
      "was all done for ‘the duty that all of us have to serve Our Lord’.\r\n",
      "Philip saw himself, if not as King David, then certainly as Moses: one of the few\r\n",
      "men capable of hearing, understanding and executing God’s will. Like Moses, he\r\n",
      "expected God to provide a miracle when the goals he had set seemed unattainable\r\n",
      "Conclusion: Agent and Structure 287\r\n",
      "by purely human means: he expected the Red Sea to part before him (and, after the\r\n",
      "victory of Lepanto, at least one of his ministers thought it had done so: see p. loi\r\n",
      "above); above all he felt confident that he could see a pillar of cloud by day and of\r\n",
      "fire by night guiding him, and those over whom he ruled, to the Promised Land.\r\n",
      "The danger with this view lay in the fact that ‘In the end, we cannot do everything\r\n",
      "with nothing’, as the duke of Parma complained to his master in 1586, ‘and one\r\n",
      "day God will grow tired of working miracles for»us’. But Philip seldom realized\r\n",
      "when the gaps between ends and means had become too large to be bridged by\r\n",
      "‘ordinary’ miracles. Even after the events of 1588 seemed to indicate that (again\r\n",
      "in Parma’s words) ‘God is sworne Englishe’, the king continued to believe that,\r\n",
      "since he fought for God’s cause, he should tolerate no compromise, allow no\r\n",
      "deviation and eschew all fall-back strategies.\r\n",
      "Warfare therefore came to be seen as the ‘normal’ state of the Monarchy. As\r\n",

      "what we have acquired or to divert our enemies’, and from his accession in 1621\r\n",
      "until his death in 1665 — as between 1577 and 1607 — Spain’s forces fought\r\n",
      "continuously on at least one front. Not surprisingly, the continuous strain of war\r\n",
      "produced a fatalism in those who made policy. When, for example, in 1619 Don\r\n",
      "Balthasar de Zuniga (Philip Ill’s principal adviser on foreign policy) considered\r\n",
      "whether Spain should go to war with the Dutch again when the Twelve Year\r\n",

      "Whether we do it [break the Truce} or do not do it, we can be sure that we shall\r\n",
      "find ourselves in a bad situation because, when matters reach a certain stage,\r\n",
      "every decision taken will be for the worst, not through lack of good advice, but\r\n",
      "because the situation is so desperate that it is not capable of remedy; and\r\n",
      "whatever policy is selected discredits whoever chose it.\r\n",
      "Six years later, Zuniga’s nephew and successor as Philip IV’s chief minister, the\r\n",
      "count-duke of Olivares, rebuked with equal fatalism a colleague who suggested\r\n",
      "that the ship of state was sinking:\r\n",
      "I do not consider a constant and despairing recitation of the state of affairs to\r\n",
      "be a useful exercise, because it cannot be concealed from those who know it at\r\n",

      "... I know the situation, I lament it, and it grieves me, but I will allow no\r\n",
      "impossibility to weaken my zeal or diminish my concern. For as the minister\r\n",
      "with paramount obligations it is for me to die unprotesting, chained to my oar,\r\n",
      "until not a single fragment is left in my hands.\r\n",
      "Fighting a major war in the sixteenth century, as today, demanded efforts of\r\n",
      "enormous magnitude and left few reserves of energy or insight to deal with the\r\n",
      "even more complex problems of how to achieve a satisfactory final outcome:\r\n",
      "288 Conclusion: Agent and Structure\r\n",
      "indeed, the longer the conflict continued, the more likely it became that the\r\n",
      "minutiae of fighting the war would divert statesmen from planning how to win\r\n",
      "the peace. Olivares, like Philip II before him, therefore tended to fix his attention\r\n",
      "on tactical and logistical issues, on coordinating complicated military and naval\r\n",
      "operations, rather than on ensuring that those issues and operations would bring\r\n",
      "peace. He regularly attempted to micromanage strategy, disconcerting and discouraging\r\n",

      "Some saw such personal failings as paramount in Spain’s failure. Philip\r\n",
      "II appeared repeatedly in the dreams of the teenage Madrid clairvoyant Lucrecia\r\n",
      "de Leon between 1587 and 1590. The images she later reported were not\r\n",
      "flattering: crowds jeered at the king because he had impoverished them; his\r\n",
      "strength failed and his subjects longed for a new ruler to lead them; most hurtful\r\n",
      "of all, a placard by the chair where he slumbered announced ‘He did not do nearly\r\n",
      "enough for the faith’. In one dream, even his daughter Isabella belittled his\r\n",
      "achievements:\r\n",
      "Look, Your Majesty, Spain is lost . . . Your Majesty is aware of the fame my\r\n",
      "grandfather. Emperor Charles V, left behind. The name of the Catholic\r\n",
      "Monarch {Ferdinand} also lives, even though he has been dead many years,\r\n",
      "and the names and glories of the holy kings of France are known everywhere. As\r\n",
      "for you, it is only said that you have impoverished your kingdom.\r\n",
      "In another of Lucrecia’s dreams Philip appeared as a new Roderick, the last\r\n",
      "Visigoth king whose licentious life was popularly believed to have caused the loss\r\n",
      "of Spain to the Moors in 711 AD. Don Juan de Silva, a discontented courtier, also\r\n",
      "blamed Philip for everything: in 1589 he confided to a friend that ‘a man of leisure\r\n",
      "and insight told me that if one considers in detail the actions of His Majesty since\r\n",
      "he began to reign . . . one could not ascribe any gain by our enemies to {their}\r\n",
      "“luck”, nor attribute any of our own successes to diligence - a melancholy\r\n",
      "thought’. Ten years later, just after the king’s death, the Jesuit Juan de Mariana\r\n",
      "penned the most damning personal indictment of all while writing about the\r\n",
      "Armada’s failure in his treatise Of kings and kingship'.\r\n",
      "Great loss was suffered on the coasts of England: we sustained that blow, that\r\n",
      "ignominy, which many years will not be able to efface. That was the retribution\r\n",
      "exacted for grave delinquencies in our nation and, unless memory fails, it was\r\n",
      "the vile lusts of a certain prince which enraged the Divinity. This prince had\r\n",

      "he had reached; and the rumour spread abroad that he had dissipated himself\r\n",
      "beyond reason in licentiousness.^^\r\n",
      "The wide range of explanations offered for Philip IPs failure - from those of\r\n",
      "Padilla, Sessa and Spmola on the one hand to Lucrecia, Silva and Mariana on the\r\n",
      "other — raises in an acute form one of the principal historiographical debates of our\r\n",
      "289\r\n",
      "time: the role of agent versus structure in historical causation. Some recent\r\n",
      "scholars have ascribed everything to structural factors. According to Henry\r\n",
      "Kamen,\r\n",
      "Philip was never at any time in adequate control of events, or of his kingdoms,\r\n",
      "or even of his own destiny. It follows that he cannot be held responsible for\r\n",
      "more than a small part of what eventually transpired during his reign . . . He\r\n",
      "was ‘imprisoned within a destiny in which he himself had little hand’. He could\r\n",
      "do little more than play the dice available to him.\r\n",
      "This is an extreme view. As John Lewis Gaddis has pointed out, ‘History is\r\n",
      "always the product of determined and contingent events: it is up to historians to\r\n",
      "find the proper balance between them’.But where does that ‘proper balance’ lie\r\n",
      "in Philip’s case?\r\n",
      "Studies of other rulers of large states under stress reveal many cases in which the\r\n",
      "role of the agent equals - and sometimes perhaps exceeds - that of the structures.\r\n",
      "The experience of the Mogul emperor Akbar (1556-1605), for example, suggests\r\n",
      "that a dramatic increase in data does not inevitably cause ‘information overload’.\r\n",
      "Akbar created an elaborate information-gathering system, with imperial agents\r\n",
      "collecting and processing the data gathered by the ‘newswriters’ placed in every\r\n",
      "sub-district throughout the empire; the emperor and his provincial governors also\r\n",
      "maintained sets of secret agents and writers, who acted as a ‘control’ on the rest;\r\n",
      "and a dense network of runners and camel-borne messengers transported a mass of\r\n",
      "official documents, orders and reports across the country under the control of the\r\n",
      "postmasters. An eminent historian has characterized the Mogul state as an ‘exercise\r\n",
      "in surveillance’; but, although Akbar was no less absolute than his contemporary\r\n",
      "Philip, the Mogul emperor did not insist on seeing all the data for himself or\r\n",
      "on using it to micromanage policy.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, the delays in communication caused by distance, coupled with\r\n",
      "the rapid increase in the amount of available data, produced significant confusion\r\n",
      "in most sixteenth-century capitals. English ministers, for example, complained\r\n",
      "about the inefficiency of their government in terms that would have won immediate\r\n",
      "recognition from their Spanish counterparts. Thus in 1596, as Elizabeth\r\n",
      "vacillated over whether or not to send more troops to fight in France, one of\r\n",
      "her courtiers expressed sentiments remarkably similar to those of Don Martin de\r\n",
      "Padilla a few months earlier (p. 282 above): ‘We had never in this court so busy\r\n",
      "a time . . . We are to provide for the saving of Ireland, the contenting of France,\r\n",
      "the winning of the Low Countries to such conditions as they are yet far from, and\r\n",
      "the discovering and preventing of designs which are now more and greater than\r\n",
      "ever.’ Somewhat later, another of the queen’s ministers lamented — as Philip’s\r\n",

      "other, he developed two systems of imperial communication, one for routine\r\n",

      "for more sensitive issues contained in secret letters sent directly to the emperor\r\n",

      "indeed, he dealt with alone in stream-of-consciousness rescripts written in his\r\n",
      "distinctive imperial vermilion ink - ‘informal, rambling, and spontaneous’, commenting\r\n",
      "on a sudden fall of snow in the capital (‘{It is} the benevolence of\r\n",

      "too many unused extra folds at the end of his report, and concluding, ‘I have\r\n",

      "fascinating recent study, ‘behind Yung-cheng’s earnest and frenzied attention to\r\n",

      "instead of blood in his veins’, proved another inveterate meddler. He acted as his\r\n",
      "own secretary of war and general-in-chief, issuing a stream of narrow instructions\r\n",
      "that hampered his generals’ freedom of action and even giving orders to subordinates\r\n",
      "directly instead of through their commanding generals; he spent an inordinate\r\n",
      "amount of time justifying his decisions whenever they ran into criticism or\r\n",
      "failure; and he insisted on compartmentalizing the entire structure of command so\r\n",
      "that he retained control of all decisions. In the words of one of his officials, ‘The\r\n",

      "Hitler deliberately created a labyrinthine system of competing structures in the\r\n",

      "immediacy of events. According to Jodi’s deputy, Walter Warlimont: ‘Hitler was,\r\n",
      "so to speak, in a little corner sheltered from the blast; neither he nor his immediate\r\n",

      "This isolation produced two important consequences. First, in an apparent\r\n",
      "attempt to counteract his seclusion. Hitler often allowed direct access to a wide\r\n",
      "range of people. According to Jodi, speaking soon after the war:\r\n",
      "There were endless ways through which the Fiihrer was informed about\r\n",
      "military matters. Every individual and every office could hand in reports\r\n",
      "direct to the adjutant’s department. The photographer sent out by the Fiihrer\r\n",
      "to take pictures at the front found it expedient to use this opportunity to report\r\n",
      "to the Fiihrer on military matters also. When I objected to this, the Fiihrer\r\n",
      "answered, ‘I do not care from whom I hear the truth; the main thing is that I\r\n",
      "hear it.’^^\r\n",
      "This was not quite true. Admittedly Hitler, like Philip II, accepted advice from\r\n",
      "all quarters while he was making up his mind on an issue; but thereafter access to\r\n",
      "Supreme Headquarters was carefully controlled and those who entered soon\r\n",
      "realized that news and views that criticized the Fiihrer’s previous decisions were\r\n",
      "not welcome. In September 1942 Jodi discovered this for himself Hitler sent him\r\n",
      "east to goad forward the commanders in the Caucasus who appeared to have\r\n",
      "become bogged down. He returned with an account of the difficulties he had\r\n",
      "witnessed — snow-covered passes and so on — which fully explained the lack of\r\n",
      "progress.\r\n",
      "I didn’t send you, Jodi [Hitler hissed}, to hear you report on all the difficulties.\r\n",
      "You were supposed to represent my view. That was your job. Instead you come\r\n",
      "back completely under the influence of the front-line commanders. You are\r\n",
      "nothing but their megaphone. I didn’t need to send you there for that.\r\n",
      "Jodi s hackles rose and he argued back; two days later, he heard that he would be\r\n",

      "personality and his actions are based.\r\n",
      "Theatre commanders proved no more successful in changing Hitler’s mind:\r\n",
      "when summoned to make a presentation or report at headquarters, none seemed\r\n",
      "able to resist the overpowering influence of the Fiihrer’s presence. Thus Heinz\r\n",
      "Guderian — son of a Prussian general, pioneer of armoured warfare, and a conspicuously\r\n",
      "successful commander in Poland, France and Russia — arrived at the Fiihrer’s\r\n",
      "headquarters in August 1941 intent on persuading Hitler to sanction a quick\r\n",
      "thrust on Moscow, instead of transferring his armoured forces southwards. In the\r\n",
      "course of a morning with Hitler, however, Guderian changed his tune Too per\r\n",

      "that the Fiihrer was firmly resolved to execute the drive to the south, it was his\r\n",
      "duty to make the impossible possible in order to put these ideas into effect’.^^\r\n",
      "The problem, as another of Hitler’s generals shrewdly put it, lay in the fact that\r\n",
      "‘The Fiihrer was interested in the very big issues, and also in the tiniest details.\r\n",
      "Anything in between did not interest him. What he overlooked was that most\r\n",
      "decisions fall into this intermediate category.’ Within that vast terrain. Hitler’s\r\n",
      "intervention tended to be erratic and unpredictable. ‘In my view,’ Chief of Staff\r\n",
      "Franz Haider wrote in 1941, ‘the situation resulting from the Fiihrer’s interference\r\n",
      "is intolerable for the Army. These individual instructions by the Fiihrer\r\n",
      "produce a situation of order, counter-order and disorder, and no one can be held\r\n",
      "responsible but he himself personally.Hitler nevertheless remained incorrigible.\r\n",
      "According to Jodi, in January 1945 the military signals system attached\r\n",
      "to the Fiihrer’s headquarters in Berlin handled 120,000 phone calls, 33,000\r\n",
      "teleprinter messages and 1,200 radio messages each and every day. It seems\r\n",
      "unlikely that any command centre at that time — let alone any supreme commander\r\n",
      "— could process effectively such a volume of traffic in order to implement\r\n",
      "a coherent strategy. Only someone with total confidence in their mission, like\r\n",
      "Hitler, would even try.^^\r\n",
      "Writing shortly after Philip II’s death. Sir Walter Raleigh attributed the king’s\r\n",
      "failure to achieve his goals to a similar overweening confidence. With reference to\r\n",
      "the Armada, Raleigh suggested that: ‘To invade by sea upon a perilous coast,\r\n",
      "being neither in possession of any port, nor succoured by any party, may better fit\r\n",
      "a prince presuming on his fortune than enriched with understanding.’ Philip did\r\n",
      "not entirely disagree: he felt sure that, thanks to his special relationship with God,\r\n",
      "he ‘understood matters differently’ from other people and therefore felt able to\r\n",
      "discount ‘the difficulties and problems that spring up’.^° It is not hard to see\r\n",
      "why. Despite all the structural problems that beset his Monarchy — distance\r\n",
