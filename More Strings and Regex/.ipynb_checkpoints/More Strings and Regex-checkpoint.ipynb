      "other Babylonian cities (Nippur, Larsa, Ur, Borsippa, Cutha and Kis/Hursagkalamma)3\n",
      "flourished after the coming ofthe Greeks. Both archaeology and textual sources indicate\n",

      "these cults more closely and present an inventory of all attested cultic activities. The\n",
      "key question will be: can we use the templejdhmligxts.as„gvideiice for Mlgalstic cuft\n",
      "practices? To answer this question we cannot restrict our research to the temple ritual\n",
      "texts alone; because these texts are literary compositions copied from older originals,\n",
      "we cannot be sure that what they depict about the public cult was actually taking place\n",
      "in the temples during the Hellenistic period. For this reason we will not only analyse the\n",

      "Some general observations\n",
      "According to Mesopotamian theology the gods are the creators of the world and of\n",
      "humans; the latter had to serve the gods in return for individual and communal prosperity\n",
      "and well-being. This service involved providing everything the gods needed to lead a '\n",
      "comfortable existence, and was formalized in order to avoid ^v mistakes or negligence,\n",
      "\"v^ich would haye had disastrous consequences for the people and their cities. This\n",
      "formalized service for the gods is the cult.\n",
      "In general, one could define a cult as a form, a practice in which the worshipping of ,\n",
      "a divinity takes place. In a cult communication with the divine is expressed in certain\n",
      "word^ formulas, gestures and actions. One usually distinguishes between, first, a more\n",
      "individual worshipping, and secondly, a common worshipping, the official cult, which\n",
      "was performed by a community; the cultisthen expressed in feasts and gatherings. Cultic\n",
      "acts such as offerings, purifications, cultic meals, prayers, incantations and processions,\n",
      "are often performed in or near sacred places like temples.\n",
      "The Mesopotamians envisaged the cult in an anthropomorphic way: although the gods\n",
      "were thought to reside in heaven and the underworld, in every Mesopotamian city many\n",
      "gods also lived in their own temples. Furthermore, each city also had its own main\n",
      "god, a city patron, who resided in the major temple, where he or she was represented\n",
      "by an anthropomorphic statue. The statues were considered to be manifestations ofthe\n",
      "gods on earth; rather than being mere images they were regarded as extensions ofthe\n",
      "personality ofthe gods. The statues were identified with the gods in question and were\n",
      "considered to be like living beings, who, just like humans, had to eat, sleep, wake and\n",
      "be dressed, and were therefore in the center of ceremonies and presented with regular ^ and special offeringsQ'he statue|‘served as the focal point for sacrificial activities’.'^^\n",
      "The cultic proceefeigs were probably based on Babylonian court practices. Like a\n",
      "king living with his family and servants in the palace, in the temple the main god of\n",
      "the city lived with other gods who acted as his family and servants. Under the guidance\n",
      "of priests the inhabitants of the city were responsible for the worship and feeding of\n",
      "the gods throughout the year. However, the temple was not a place were everyone came\n",
      "together to worship the god. Only certain priests and other temple personnel, who were\n",
      "able to perform the often elaborate ceremonies and rituals, and on occasion, for example\n",
      "during the New Year festival, the king or a high official of the city, had access to the\n",

      "aldtu)!^ In the Hellenistic period isinnu is not attested in ritual texts. However, we\n",

      "II.l. Introduction\n",
      "Important elements of the cult are the ceremony, the ritual and the religious festival.\n",
      "A ceremony is a religious custom or rite for the opening or continuation of contact\n",
      "between man and the divine. The ceremony, together with the seasons (with which it\n",
      "was originally closely connected), was the basis for the chronology of the cultic year:\n",
      "the fixed days ofthe months, on which the ceremonies had to be performed, resulted in\n",
      "a calendar which was based on the cult.\n",
      "Rituals and festivals consist of a complex of ceremonies, each of which have their\n",
      "own function, combined together to serve a different purpose. In general this purpose\n",
      "consists in averting evil which may threaten an individual or the community, by following\n",
      "a'fixed set of rules which describe how humans must serve the gods and in return enjoy\n",
      "a secure and pleasant life.\n",
      "The Mesopotamians offered mythological explanations for the cultic activities in\n",
      "the ritual texts. According to the Mesopotamians a ritual is often a re-enactment of a\n",
      "myth, because, as Lambert noted, they considered myths not to have happened once in\n",
      "a remote past, but were regarded to occur at regular intervals.^ It is often difficult for us\n",
      "to assess how the Mesopotamians conceived a ritual to be connected with a particular\n",
      "myth. Sometimes the ritual itself contains an explanation. We also have explanatory\n",
      "texts which ‘explain’ some of these connections.^ As Livingstone concluded, because\n",
      "for the Mesopotamians there is no fundamental difference between myth and ritual, the\n",
      "statues and symbols which are used in the temple rituals are in fact the deities which\n",
      "they represent, and the rituals in which they take part are therefore myths. These myths\n",
      "usually deal with struggles between major deities, which are derived from mythological\n",
      "events described in the epics Enuma elis and Anzu. People mentioned in the rituals\n",
      "correspond to victorious deities in the myths, while animals or objects correspond to\n",
      "defeated deities or demons.^\n",
      "In texts from Mesopotamia we find no clear definition of a ceremony. We do have an\n",
      "interesting enumeration of several ceremonies from Uruk in TU 38, which describes\n",
      "the amount of foodstuffs and drinks which have to be brought into the temples daily.^\n",
